## Scriptures
**[Mark 7:24-30](Mark7)**

Ref: [Hebrews 11:6](Hebrews11#v.6)

### Intro
Last week talked about the two most important commands God gives us. Today I want to specifically talk about a way we can love God with all our hearts, mind, soul, and strength.

I want to talk about how we are able to MOVE GOD'S HEART.

### Story of moving dad's heart
Father comes home from long day of work. He opens the door to his three young boys running around clamoring and playing with each other while he sees his wife still preparing dinner.

He routinely takes on his shift in watching over the kids until dinner is prepared. He stations himself on a couch in his house where he is able to see all his kids. One of his children notices his fatigue. He was beat.

This child takes the initiative in bringing him a diet Coke, knowing that this was his favorite beverage. The father receives the diet Coke with a faint smile. He then grabs two cups and pours some for his son as well. They exchange a glance that only them two share. His son truly sees the pleasure his father felt in him giving him a diet Coke, knowing that it will please Him.

The father still loves his other kids JUST AS MUCH. He would have done the same if another child had done the same thing. But, he pours the drink for his son and shows him affection since this child was the one that gave him the thing that pleases him most.

This doesn't make the other kids competitive for their father's affections. Rather, it encourages their hearts to see their dad joyful while relaxing on the couch. Seeing their Father pleased makes them pleased.

### Point 1
God is attracted towards righteous hunger and desperation.

Let's dig into the Syrophoneician woman's heart posture.

She's hungry, desperate, humble, persistent, and ASKS with urgency.

### Point 2
Faith pleases God.

Hebrews 11:6 says that and it also says that God rewards those who earnestly seek him.

Being vague in FAITH/PRAYERS towards God is safe, but there's no gain.

Real faith sees real results.

Example of getting a gift. If you tell them specifically what actual item you want, the response of the recipient is underwhelming. *story of Alvin 1st year*. But when you say a category of gift that you'd like to receive, it's that much more enjoyable.

GREAT FAITH MOVES GOD. Put away with shallow faith. Why give your wife a $50 ring when you're able to get her a $2000 one!?

"I refuse to have just a little bit of you."

God wants to bless his children. SURRENDER FIRST, then ASK BIG. And contend with God! Move his heart!

### Point 3
What does it mean to move God's heart?

We move God's heart when we see His love confirmed in our prayers and His love affirmed in our hearts.

It isn't persuading him to do somehting for you. We're not negotiating with an obstinate, neglectful God. 

No, God is actually pleased when we contend with Him. The faith to see God's will come to pass in our lives and in others' lives **pleases Him**.

When we move God's heart, we collide our cries for Him to act on our behalf with His will. 

Moving God's heart is when we touch God's heart with our hunger, desperation, and FAITH, so we could see His love in action in the petitions we present before Him. 

His love is already there. He's not an obstinate or neglectful God. But since FAITH pleases him, we have an invitation to please God. IMAGINE THAT. We all have the same access to bring pleasure to God's heart.


### Conclusion

God has emotions and thoughts. He can be pleased and displeased! He's not some ethereal being conjured up by the every positive attributes.

So is God pleased with our house church? Do we have faith that can move God's heart? Are we hungry for more of him or are we satisfied with the little we have of Him now?

### Discussion

What are some things that friends have done that moves YOUR heart? (What pleases you?)

How does knowing that "we are able to move God's heart" change your view of God?

What did you learn from seeing the example of the Syrophoneician woman?
