## Scriptures
Philippians 3:1-14

### Intro
I'm genuinely grateful to say that I know you all. The time I spend with you are experiences I wouldn't want to trade for any other group. I mean that.

The value in knowing you all isn't just in the fun, quirks, and laughs we all have. It's that it costs me something. I could be spending this time making more friends in my major which results in more connections and opportunities which can lead to a safer expectation for my career.

### Anecdote


### Point 1
**Have an intelligent affection**

Relate back to message of encouragement. Don't give generic humanistic words of comfort. Really try to encourage people. Try to notice the little things they do *or don't do* that make you really appreciate them.

See good, say good. You can't love people if you always focus on their weaknesses and lacking. You have nothing to encourage someone about if 1) you're prone to see sides of them you don't like first or 2) you aren't intentionally trying to grow in your knowledge of them so you can love them in more abundance.

### Point 2

**The BEST things are all found in Him**
