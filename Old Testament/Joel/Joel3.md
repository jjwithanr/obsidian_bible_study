# Joel 3

## Overview:



#### v.3
>They cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes; they sold girls for wine that they might drink.

It was customary with conquerors, in those days, to divide the captives, taken in war, among themselves by lot, and so did these enemies of the Jews. These instances are mentioned, to signify the contempt in which these enemies of the Jews held the worshippers of the true God; they parted with them, when they had taken them captives, upon the vilest terms, as setting little or no value upon them. In Mingrelia, according to Sir John Chardin, they sell captive children for provisions and for wine: see Harmer vol. 2. p. 374.

Every regenerate soul admits their entire worth is in Christ and that the world, along with those of it, treat them as worthless here below.

#### v.14
>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.

Lord, help me to realize I'm in the valley of decision upon your convictions.
#jj 

#### v.21
>Their bloodguilt, which I have not pardoned, I will pardon." The Lord dwells in Zion!

For in that He punishes the shedding of it, He declared the "blood" innocent, whose shedding He punished. So in the Revelation it is said, "I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held, and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" [Revelation 6:10-11](http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm).
