# Exodus 14

## Overview:



#### v.13
>Moses answered, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again."

#### v.14
>The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.

Moses told the people of Israel to _stop_. This is often the LORDâ€™s direction to the believer in a time of crisis. _Despair_ will cast you down, keeping you from standing. _Fear_ will tell you to retreat. _Impatience_ will tell you to do something now. _Presumption_ will tell you to jump into the Red Sea before it is parted. Yet as God told Israel He often tells us to simply **stand still** and **hold your peace** as He reveals His plan.

#### v.15
>Then the Lord said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on."

There is a time for praying, but there is also a time for holy activity. Prayer is adapted for almost every season, yet not prayer alone, for there comes, every now and then, a time when even prayer must take a secondary place.
