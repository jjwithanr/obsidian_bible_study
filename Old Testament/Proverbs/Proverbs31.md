# Proverbs31

## Overview:



#### v.3
>do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings.

The vigour of thy mind and body, which is greatly impaired by inordinate lusts, as all physicians agree, and frequent experience shows; nor thy ways — Thy conversation or course of life; to that which destroyeth kings — The same thing repeated in other words, as is very usual in these books; to the **immoderate love of women, which is most destructive to kings and kingdoms**, as was well known to Solomon, by the example of his father David, and by many other sad examples, left upon record in all histories.

LOL. Why does no one quote this verse when mentioning a Proverbs 31 woman? Gotta love the context for Proverbs 31.
