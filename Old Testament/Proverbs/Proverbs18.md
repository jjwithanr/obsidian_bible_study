# Proverbs 18

## Overview:



#### v.9
>One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.

#### v.19
>An offended brother is more unyielding than a foritified city, and disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.

#### v.22
>He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.

The Septuagint adds "He who casts out a good wife, casts away that which is good: but he that keepeth an adulteress is foolish and ungodly."

This convicted my elevated stance on celibacy. By rejoicing in not wanting to get married (out of cynicism), I was casting out a blessing God intended for my life. Casting out a good wife in the Greek uses ekballo, meaning insistently refusing a good wife welcomes a life of sexual immorality

In Hebrew, the wording of Proverbs 18:22 is strikingly similar to that of [Proverbs 8:35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%208.35): “For those who find me find life and receive favor from the LORD.” _Me_ in this verse refers to [wisdom](https://www.gotquestions.org/wisdom-she-Proverbs.html), suggesting that, after wisdom itself, the **finest of God’s blessings is an excellent wife.** [Proverbs 31:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%2031.10) makes a parallel analogy: “A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies” (cf. [Proverbs 8:11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%208.11)).
