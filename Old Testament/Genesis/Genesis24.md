# Genesis 24

## Overview:

#### v.33
>Then the food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say."

Like every true servant of Christ, **he put his masterâ€™s business before his own ease or comfort**; even before the question of necessary food. When a man begins to think more of his eating than of doing the will of God, he ceases to be a true-hearted minister.
