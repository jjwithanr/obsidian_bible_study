# Genesis 14

## Overview:



#### v.13
>One who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.

The word Hebrew comes from a root that means _passed over._ The Septuagint translates it _the passenger_.

#### v.19-20
>and he blessed Abram, saying "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. <sup>20</sup>And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand." Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

#### v.21
>The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself."

Abram must choose a king to obey. The king of Sodom, who is without subjects, promises Abram with the fruit of their own labors. Melchizedek blesses Abram with God's blessing which is not of himself but from God Himself. The king of Sodom's reward will have been received immediately and had direct benefit to all his peoples. Yet, God's reward is one of great promise and calling over the generations coming after Abram. Often, we confuse man's approval and blessing with God's blessing. The man of God is first called and blessed by God; he does not leave that path nor seek any other blessing.

#### v.23
>that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the thong of sandal, so that you will never be able to say, 'I made Abram rich.'

Abram refused any portion of the plunder because he would not allow anyone say that a man had made Abram rich. Abram determined that all of the credit for his success and wealth should go to God and God alone.

If success does come when we pursue human measures of success, using man-centered wisdom and methods, how can we really say that God gave the success? It is much better to follow Godâ€™s wisdom so that when success comes He gets the glory, and it is evident to everyone that it was His work.
