# Psalm 33

## Overview:



#### v.18
>But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,

Godâ€™s eye is upon His people: their eye is upon Him. In waiting upon God, our eye, looking up to Him, meets His looking down upon us. This is the blessedness of waiting upon God, that it takes our eyes and thoughts away from ourselves, even our needs and desires, and occupies us with our God.
