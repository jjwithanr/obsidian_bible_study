# Psalm 25

## Overview:



#### v.3
>No one whose hope is in you will ever be put to shame, but they will be put to shame who are treacherous without excuse.

#### v.14
>The Lord confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.

The word “friendship” would perhaps express the meaning here. The sense is, that those who fear the Lord are admitted to the intimacy of friendship with Him; are permitted to come into His presence, and to partake of His counsels; are allowed free access to Him; or, as it is more commonly expressed, have “fellowship” with Him. Compare [1 John 1:3](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=1jo+1:3&t1=eng_nas&sr=1). The language is such as would be applied to the intimacy of friends, or to those who take counsel together. The language belongs to a large class of expressions denoting the close connection between God and His people.
