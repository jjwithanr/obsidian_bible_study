# Psalm 130

## Overview:



#### v.3
>If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord, who could stand?

#### v.4
>But with you there is forgiveness; therefore you are feared.

The offender is so pardoned that he is disposed to worship and honor God, for God has revealed himself as one who forgives sin, in order that the sinner may be encouraged to come to him, and be his true worshipper.

The word rendered ‘forgiveness’…. literally means cutting off, and so suggests the merciful surgery by which the cancerous tumour is taken out of the soul.

But pardon—free pardon, perfect pardon, pardon given on the spot to simple faith—they tell us that this would tend to demoralize people. Well, that is a subject on which they can speak, for nobody has demoralized people more than so-called “priests” have done, but it is evident that God does not agree with them. It is written here, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, “There is forgiveness with thee, that thou may be feared,” so that, **instead of destroying any man’s fear, or reverence, or religion, the gift of a free pardon is to be the very means of producing such a condition of heart and life.**
