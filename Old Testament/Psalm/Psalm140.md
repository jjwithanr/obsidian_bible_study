# Psalm 140

## Overview:



#### v.2
>May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.

#### v.5
>Let a righteous man strike me - it is a kindness; let him rebuke me - it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it.

#### v.8
>But my eyes are **fixed on you**, O Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge - do not give over to death.

My hope is in thee. I do not rely on my own power. I do not trust in my armed forces. I know that they are weak, dispirited, scattered - like strewed bones - like the chips and splinters lying around the place where wood is chopped. I look, therefore, solely to God. I believe that he "will" interpose; and now that my enemy has placed himself in this position, I do not need to resort to stealthful arts - to dishonorable acts - to assassination - as my friends advise, but the object will be accomplished, and I shall be placed on the throne by the act of God, and in a manner that will not subject my name and memory to reproach by a base and treacherous deed.
