# Psalm 67

## Overview:



#### v.1
>May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine upon us

 To know that as God looks upon you, He is well pleased – not because of who you are, or what you have done, but because you are in Jesus Christ – there is no greater source of peace and power in life.

 Why should he fret when **God smiles**? What matters though all the world should censure, if Jehovah countenances his servant. A look of approval from God creates a deep, delightful calm within the soul.
