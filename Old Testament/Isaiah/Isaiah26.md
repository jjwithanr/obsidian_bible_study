# Isaiah 26

## Overview:



#### v.3
>You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.

There is something very beautiful in the prophet’s abandoning the attempt to find any adjective of quality which adequately characterises the peace of which he has been speaking. He falls back upon the expedient which is the confession of the impotence of human speech worthily to portray its subject when he simply says, ‘Thou shalt keep in peace, peace . . . because he trusteth in Thee.’
