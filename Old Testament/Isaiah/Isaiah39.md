# Isaiah 39

## Overview:



#### v.2
>Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses - the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

It semeed wicked to God's sight for man to boastfully count all their glories. Paul shows the Christian ought to count it all as loss compared to the surpassing glory of knowing Christ. Count is a creature word for it denotes something quantifiable. God is countless. Even large quantities of glory essentially proves its smallness when put next to a God whose glory cannot be counted.

#### v.6
>The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord.

Beloved, what a warning we must heed and a blessing we must receive. All the riches we have accumulated shall be carried off to posterity but so as our sufferrings. Our iniquities and dying arrogant flesh shall be carried off when the Son of Man returns to find our faith while here on earth.

#### v.8
>"The word of the Lord you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "There will be peace and security in my lifetime."

Shall we contrast God's prophet, Moses, who sought the Lord for salvation in His generation even though His covenants stood true to Him. Look at [Exodus 32:9-14](Exodus32).
