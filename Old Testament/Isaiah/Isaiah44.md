# Isaiah 44

## Overview:



#### v.3
>For I will pour out water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.

How can we experience an outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon our church that fills us with indomitable joy and frees us and empowers us to love those around us in ways so authentic that they are won to Christ? Answer: **meditate day and night upon the incomparable, hope-giving promises of God.** That's the way Paul kept his heart full of hope and joy and love. He said (in [Romans 15:4](Romans15.md#v.4)).

I believe that, at this present moment, Godâ€™s people ought to cry to him day and night that there may be a fresh baptism into the Holy Ghost. There are many things that are desirable for the Church of Christ, but one thing is absolutely needful; and this is the one thing, the power of the Holy Ghost in the midst of his people.

#### v.6
>"This is the what the Lord says - Israel's King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.

#### v.18
>They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.

The idolater chose a delusion and became deluded.

#### v.20
>He feeds on ashes, a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?"

And such passages as these are added in such cases to give an account of the prodigious madness of sinners herein; because, as they wilfully shut their own eyes, and harden their own hearts, so God judicially blinds and hardens them, and gives them up to believe lies, and then it is no wonder if they fall into such dotages.

The idolater picks up the figurine in his hand, holding it, but in reality it holds him. He is in bondage to _a lie_.
