# Isaiah 7

## Overview:



#### v.9
>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.' "

He was anxious about the means of defense, but did not trust in the promise of God by the prophet. Isaiah, therefore, assures him, that if he did not believe him; if he did not put confidence in God, and his promises, he should not be protected from Syria and Ephraim. They would come and destroy his kingdom. 'You have no occasion,' is the language of the prophet, 'to fear. God has resolved to protect you, and no portion of your land shall be taken by your enemies. Nevertheless, in order that you may obtain deliverance, you must believe his promise, and put your confidence in him, and not in the aid of the Assyrians. If you do this, your mind shall be calm, peaceful, and happy. But if you do "not" do this; if you rely on the aid of Assyria, you shall be troubled, alarmed, unsuccessful, and bring ruin upon yourself and nation.' This, therefore, is an exhortation to **confide solely in the promises of God**, and is one of the instances constantly occurring in the Old Testament and the New, showing, that by faith or confidence in God only, can the mind he preserved calm when in the midst of dangers.

#### v.11
>"Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights."

#### v.12
>But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the Lord to the test."

In this case Ahaz assumed the appearance of piety, or respect for the command of God. In [Deuteronomy 6:16](Deut6#v.16), it is written, 'Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God;' and Ahaz perhaps had this command in his eye. It was a professed reverence for God. But the true reason why he did not seek this sign was, that he had already entered into a negotiation with the king of Assyria to come and defend him; and that he was even stripping the temple of God of its silver and gold, to secure this assistance; [2 Kings 16:7-8](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm). **When people are depending on their own devices and resources, they are unwilling to seek aid from God**; and **it is not uncommon if they excuse their want of trust in him by some appearance of respect for religion.**

Secret disaffection to God is often disguised with the colour of respect to him; and those who are resolved that they will not trust God, yet pretend they will not tempt him.
