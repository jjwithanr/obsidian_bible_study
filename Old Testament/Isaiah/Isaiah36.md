# Isaiah 36

## Overview:



#### v.6
>Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharoah king of Egypt to all who depend on him.

Satan attacks us the same way! Often, even when he tells the truth (“You are such a rotten sinner!”), he never does it to lead us to a firm trust in the LORD our God (“Jesus died for sinners, so if I am a rotten sinner, Jesus died to forgive and free me!”). Instead, **Satan’s strategy – even if he tells us the truth – is always to demoralize us and drive us to despair.**

#### v.15
>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord when he says, 'The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'

The enemies of God's people cannot succeed in their designs against them until they can unsettle their confidence in Him.
