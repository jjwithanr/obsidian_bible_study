# 3 John

## Overview:

#### v.2
> Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.

And the worst thing that could happen to many Christian people would be what they fret, and fume, and work themselves into a fever, and live careful days and sleepless nights in order to secure-and that is, outward prosperity. The best thing is that the soul should be more prosperous than the body, and the **worst adversity is the outward prosperity that ruins or harms the inward life.**

>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.

#### v.9
>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes who loves to be first, will have nothing to do with us.



#### v.11
>Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
