# Galations 4

## Overview:



#### v.7
>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.

#### v.8-9
>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. <sup>9</sup>But now that you know God - or rather are known by God - how is it that you are turning back to be enslaved by them all over again?

How are you being enslaved by YouTube and media all over again?

#### v.11
>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.

What pastor has not often had such fears of his people, when he sees them turn to the weak and beggarly elements of the world, or when, after having "run well," he sees them become the slaves of fashion, or of some habit inconsistent with the simplicity of the gospel?
