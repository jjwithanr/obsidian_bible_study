# Galations 6

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritiual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you may also be tempted.

Forgiveness is different from restoration.

#### v.2
>Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

#### v.4
>Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,

Here is the true secret of happiness. It consists:

(1) **in not forming an improper estimate of ourselves;** in knowing just what we are, and what is due to us; in not thinking ourselves to be something, when we are nothing.

(2) **in leading such a life that it may be examined to the core, that we may know exactly what we are without being distressed or pained.** That is, in having a good conscience, and in the honest and faithful discharge of our duty to God and man.

(3) **in not being dependent on the fickle applause of the world for our comfort.** The man who has no internal resources, and who has no approving conscience; who is happy only when others smile, and miserable when they frown, is a man who can have no security for enjoyment. The man who has a good conscience, and who enjoys the favor of God, and the hope of heaven, carries with him the source of perpetual joy. He cannot be deprived of it. His purse may be taken, and his house robbed, but the highwayman cannot rob him of his comforts. He carries with him an unfailing source of happiness when abroad, and the same source of happiness abides with him at home; he bears it into society, and it remains with him in solitude; it is his companion when in health, and when surrounded by his friends, and it is no less his companion when his friends leave him, and when he lies upon a bed of death.

#### v.7
>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.

Private victory leads to public victory.
