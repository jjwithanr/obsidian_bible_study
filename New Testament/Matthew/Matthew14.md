#### v.31
>Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"

Jesus mirrors the Father's heart in [Matthew 12:11-12](Matthew11#v.11-12) in his rescuing of Peter.

He had less real faith than he supposed, and more ardor than his faith would justify. He was rash, headlong, incautious, really attached to Jesus, but still easily daunted and prone to fall. He was afraid, therefore, when in danger, and, sinking, cried again for help. Thus he was suffered to learn his own character, and his dependence on Jesus: a lesson which all Christians are permitted sooner or later to learn by dear-bought experience.
