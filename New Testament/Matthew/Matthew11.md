#### v.11-12
>He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? <sup>12</sup>How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

The Father's heart; as swift as our fall is His grasp of the outreached hand.
