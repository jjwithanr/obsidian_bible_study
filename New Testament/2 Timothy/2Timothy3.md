# 2 Timothy 3

## Overview
Paul warns of a great apostasy taking place in the end times where people will misplace their love and appear outwardly as Christians yet have no power in the Spirit. Those who teach false tachings or live as fake Christians will progress from bad to worse while men of godly pursuit, like Timothy, will endure more persecution that he might be completely equipped for every good work.

#### v.2-3 [[wealth,work]], [[family]]
>People will be **lovers of themselves**, [lovers of money](wealth,work.md), boastful, proud, abusive, **disobedient to their parents**, ungrateful, unholy, <sup>3</sup>**without love**, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,

"without love" in verse 3 comes from the Greek word, *astorgos* , which is more accurately translated as "without natural affection." The only other time this specific word is used is in [Romans 1:31](Romans1.md) as the word, "heartless." Paul seems to repeatedly measure one's character by their love and respect for their immediate family.

The "list of vices" vividly describes the negative impact of those who were opposing Paul and Timothy. The list begins and ends with references to *misplaced love*💔 - i.e., people who are **lovers of self**, **lovers of money**, and **lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God**

This could possibly be connected to why Paul prays the [Phillipians'](Phillipians1) love would abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight so that they wouldn't misplace their love and leave the sound teachings he left them with.

#### v.4
>treacherous, rash, conceited, **lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God -**.

See [1 Timothy 5:6](1Timothy5.md) on living for pleasure.

Of a large portion of mankind it may be said that this is their characteristic, that they live for pleasure; **they have no serious pursuits**; they brook no restraints which interfere with their amusements, and they greatly prefer the pleasures to be found in the gay assembly, in the ball-room, or in the place of low dissipation, **to the friendship of their Creator**.

#### v.5
>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Having nothing to do with them.

In all respects, except in the form of religion, they live as if they had None (Christian Athiest by Craig Groeschel).  This has been common in the world...It is much easier for people to **observe the forms of religion** than it is to **bring the heart under its controlling influence**.

#### v.7
> always learning, but never able to acknowledge the truth.

Many obtain much speculative acquaintance with the “doctrines” of Christianity, but never become savingly acquainted with the system; many study the constitution and government of the church, but **remain strangers to practical piety**; many become familiar with the various philosophical theories of religion, but never become truly acquainted with what religion is; and many embrace visionary theories, who never show that they are influenced by the spirit of the gospel. Nothing is more common than for persons to be very busy and active in religion, and even to “learn” many things about it, who still remain strangers to the saving power of the gospel.

#### v.8
>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth - men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.

Good encouragement to evangelists. We are to expect many to oppose the truth. See note in [2 Thessalonians 3:2](2Thess3#v.2) for how Paul responds.

#### v.12
> In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,

1. That they who make a profession of religion, **should come prepared to be persecuted**. It should be considered as one of the** proper qualifications for membership in the church, to be willing to bear persecution, and to [resolve](Philippians3.md) not to shrink from any duty in order to avoid it**.
1. They who are persecuted for their opinions, should consider that this may be one evidence that **they have the spirit of Christ, and are his true friends**
1. Before we avail ourselves of this consolation, whether we are persecuted because we “live godly in Christ Jesus,” or for some other reason. A man may embrace some absurd opinion, and call it religion; he may adopt some mode of dress irresistibly ludicrous, from the mere love of singularity, and may call it “conscience;” or he may be boorish in his manners, and uncivil in his deportment, outraging all the laws of social life, and may call this “deadness to the world;” and for these, and similar things, he may be contemned, ridiculed, and despised. 
1. Let those who have never been persecuted in any way, inquire whether it is not an evidence that they have no religion. If they had been more faithful, and more like their Master, would they have always escaped? It is easy for a professed Christian to avoid persecution, if he yields every point in which religion is opposed to the world.

#### v.15
>and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

The Scriptures have “power.” They are “able to make one wise to salvation.” They are not a cold, tame, dead thing. There is no book that has so much “power” as the Bible; none that is so efficient in moving the hearts, and consciences, and intellects of mankind. There is no book that has moved so many minds; none that has produced so deep and permanent effects on the world.

#### v.16
>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

**All Scripture** would refer first to the OT but by implication also to at least some NT writings, which by this time were already being considered as Scripture ([1 Timothy 5:18](1Timothy5.md), [2 Peter v.15-16](2Peter3.md)).

#### v.17
>so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

No new phase of human affairs can appear in which it will not direct him; no new plan of benevolence can be started, for which he will not find principles there to guide him; and he can make no progress in knowledge or holiness, where he will not feel that his holy counsellor is in advance of him still, and that it is capable of conducting him even yet into higher and purer regiones. Let us, then, study and prize the Bible...We are often in circumstances in which **we feel that we have reached the outer limit of what man can teach us**; but we ***never*** get into such circumstance in regard to the Word of God.
#barnes 
This supports the doctine of "sufficiency of Scripture" that is, the idea that the truth contained in Scripture is **sufficient in all matters pertaining to doctrine and moral behavior**... this does not exclude individual guidance by the Holy Spirit on how to apply the universal commands of Scripture in particular situations ([Galations 5:16,18](Galations5)).
