# 2 Timothy 1

## Overview:
Paul's introduction in this letter is slightly different as he includes *mercy* in the opening thanksgiving statement. Enduring word expands on this subtle addition as a call for ministers, like that of Timothy, to seek after God's mercy all the more since they are doing God's work.
Then he recalls Timothy's background and encourages him to stay faithful in his present sufferings by reminding him of the reason they are suffering - the Gospel. In light of the adversity, Paul commands Timothy to "guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you." - where the good deposity is sound doctrinal teaching.
After mentioning how he was abandoned in Asia all to himself, Paul lists people who have either deserted him or refereshed him.

#### v.6
>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

The idea is, that Timothy was to use all proper means to keep the flame of pure religion in the soul burning, and more particularly his zeal in the great cause to which he had been set apart. The agency of man himself is needful to keep the religion of the heart warm and glowing. However rich the gifts which God has bestowed upon us, they do not grow of their own accord, but need to be cultivated by our own personal care.

#### v.7
>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and self-discipline.

The Greek word denotes one of sober mind; a man of prudence and discretion. The state referred to here is that in which the mind is well balanced, and under right influences; in which **it sees things in their just proportions and relations; in which it is not feverish and excited, but when everything is in its proper place.** It was this state of mind which Timothy was exhorted to cultivate; this which Paul regarded as so necessary to the performance of the duties of his office. It is as needful now for the minister of religion as it was then.

#### v.12
>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to **guard what I have entrusted to him** for that day.

#### v.14
>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you - guard it **with the help of the Holy Spirit** who lives in us.

One of the best methods of preserving the knowledge and the love of truth is to cherish the influences of the Holy Spirit.

>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
