# 1 Timothy 5

## Overview:
Paul instructs Timothy on how he ought to treat the older and younger men and women in his church as a young minister. He identifies which widows are qualified to receive help from the church. Paul gives honor to the elders who do take care of these widows and diligently work for the church. Yet, he also sets standards and warnings for them.


#### v.1-2
>Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, <sup>2</sup>**older women as mothers**, and younger women as sisters, with **absolute purity**.

He knew the danger which would beset a youthful minister of the gospel when it was his duty to admonish and entreat a youthful female; he knew, too, the scandal to which he might be exposed if, in the performance of the necessary duties of his office, there should be the slightest departure from purity and propriety. He was therefore to guard his heart with more than common vigilance in such circumstances, and was to indulge in no word, or look, or action, which could by any possibility be construed as manifesting an improper state of feeling. On nothing else do the fair character and usefulness of a youthful minister more depend, than on the observance of this precept. Nowhere else does he more need the grace of the Lord Jesus, and the exercise of prudence, and the manifestation of incorruptible integrity, than in the performance of this duty. A youthful minister who fails here, can never recover the perfect purity of an unsullied reputation, and never in subsequent life be wholly free from suspicion; compare notes, [Matthew 5:28](Matthew5#v.28)
