# 1 Timothy 6

## Overview:
Paul returns to his correction of the false teachers' doctrines. He addreses their anthem for asceticism and clarifies that having a balance of both godliness and contenement is good since it guards the heart from the love of money. Paul sternly warns Timothy of such vices like the love of money and teaches him how to treat the wealthy in the church.
