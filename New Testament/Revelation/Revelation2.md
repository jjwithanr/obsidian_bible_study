# Revelation 2

## Overview:



#### v.4
>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken your first love.

#### v.6
>But you have this in your favor: You hate the principles of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

Jesus can hate specific movements and teachers. Just as he called out Pharisees face to face he calls out false teachers by name.

#### v.7
>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.

#### v.9
>I know your afflictions and your poverty - **yet you are rich!** I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

The poor should always be cheerful and happy, if they can hear their Saviour saying unto them, "I know thy poverty - but thou art rich." However keen the feeling arising from the reflection "I am a poor man," the edge of the sorrow is taken off if the mind can be turned to a brighter image - "but thou art rich."

#### v.20
>Nevertheless, I have this against you: **You tolerate that woman Jezebel**, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.

#### v.21
>I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.

**Time to repent** shows _mercy_. God gives us **time to repent**, we should deal with others the same way. **And she did not repent** speaks to the _judgment_ of God. God gives **time to repent**, but it is not an unlimited time. There is a time when God says, _My Spirit shall not strive with man forever_ ([Genesis 6:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+6.3&t=NKJV)). This means that when God gives us **time to repent**, we must _take advantage_ of that time.

This is biblical backing for the term often used, "window of mercy" or "window for repentance" that I hear many church-goers say.

#### v.24
>Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets (I will not impose **any other burden** on you):

See [[grace#Barnes on Revelation 2 24 Revelation2 v 24]].

#### v.26
>To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations - 

Fred Markert on authority over the nations being linked to tolerating spirit of Jezebel.
