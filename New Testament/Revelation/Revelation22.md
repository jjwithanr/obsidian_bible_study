# Revelation 22

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.7
>"Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book."

Similar to [Revelation 1:3](Revelation1#v.3).

#### v.9
>But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"

#### v.10
>Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near."

**Daniel had been instructed to seal up his words until the end time** (Dan 12:4, 9); some of his visions had applied only to the future (Dan 8:26; 9:24; 10:14; cf. Jer 23:20; 30:24; 1 Enoch 100:6). By contrast, **Johnâ€™s revelation is meant to be understood in his own generation as well as subsequently** (which should affect how subsequent generations understand his book). On opening sealed documents, see comment on 5:1
