# Revelation 19

## Overview:


#### v.8
>Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear." (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints.)

Pure linen was mandatory apparel for the \*high priest entering the holy of holies (Lev 16:4), extended in time to all ministers in the sanctuary; angels were often supposed to be dressed in linen too (probably based on Dan 12:6-7). Its symbolic use for purity and (here) righteous deeds would thus be natural. In Revelation it partcularly contrasts with the prostitute’s fine linen (18:12, 16).

#### v.10
>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

The word "prophecy" here seems to be used in the large sense in which it is often employed in the New Testament - meaning to make known the divine will (see the notes on [Romans 12:6](https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm)), and the primary reference here would seem to be to the preachers and teachers of the New Testament. The sense is, that their grand business is to bear testimony to the Saviour. They are all - whether angels, apostles, or ordinary teachers - appointed for this, and therefore should regard themselves as "fellow-servants." The design of the angel in this seems to have been, to state to John what was his own specific business in the communications which he made, and then to state a universal truth applicable to all ministers of the gospel, that they were engaged in the same work, and that no one of them should claim adoration from others.

Most of early Judaism associated the \*Spirit of God with the spirit of \*prophecy; for John, witnesses of Jesus dependent on the Spirit (thus, ideally, all Christians) were prophets in the broadest sense of the term. It was, in fact, the proper witness to Jesus that distinguished true prophets from false ones (1 Jn 4:1-6), an important issue among some of the book’s hearers (Rev 2:20).

#### v.12
>His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.

That his name is unknown might be meant to imply that no one has power over him (ancient magicians claimed that they could coerce spirits once they knew their names); compare Revelation 2:17.
