# Hebrews 4

## Overview:
Continuing of his example of the Israelites failing to enter God's rest due to their unbelief, the author emphasizes to the reader that faith is necessary to enter God's rest. He provides OT support to show that some can still enter his rest through an active faith that doesn't fall short. He then states the word is a double edged sword and that Jesus allows us to approach God's throne with confidence.

#### v.1
>Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.

This verse teaches the important truth that, though heaven is offered to us, and that a “rest” is promised to us if we seek it, yet that there is reason to think that many may fail of reaching it who had expected to obtain it. Among those will be the following classes:
1.  Those who are professors of religion but who have never known anything of true piety.
1. Those who are expecting to be saved by their own works, and are looking forward to a world of rest on the ground of what their own hands can do.
1. Those who defer attention to the subject from time to time until it becomes too late. They expect to reach heaven, but they are not ready to give their hearts to God “now,” and the subject is deferred from one period to another, until death arrests them unprepared.
1. Those who have been awakened to see their guilt and danger, and who have been almost but not quite ready to give up their hearts to God. Such were Agrippa, Felix, the young ruler [Mark 10:21](Mark10#v.21), and such are all those who are “almost” but not “quite” prepared to give up the world and to devote themselves to the Redeemer. To all these the promise of “rest” is made, if they will accept of salvation as it is offered in the gospel; all of them cherish a hope that they will be saved; and all of them are destined alike to be disappointed. With what earnestness, therefore, should we strive that we may not fail of the grace of God!

#### v.2
>For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not **combine it with faith.**

They are assured that God is willing to save them, and that the Redeemer stands with open arms to welcome them to heaven. They are trained up under the gospel; are led early in life to the sanctuary; are in the habit of attending on the preaching of the gospel all their days, but still what they hear exerts no saving influence on their hearts.

#### v.9-10
>There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; <sup>10</sup>for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.

Labor while is is called today. Soon we shall cease from our work. All that we have to do is to be done soon. We shall soon cease from “our” work as God did from his. What we have to do for the salvation of children, brothers, sisters, friends, and for the world, is to be done soon. From the abodes of bliss we shall not be sent forth to speak to our kindred of the blessedness of that world, or to admonish our friends to escape from the place of despair. The pastor will not come again to warn and invite his people; the parent will not come again to tell his children of the Saviour and of heaven; the neighbor will not come to admonish his neighbor; compare [Luke 16:24-29](Luke16#v.24). We shall all have ceased from our work as God did from his; and never again shall we speak to a living friend to invite him to heaven.

#### v.11
>Let us, therefore,, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.

Let us earnestly strive. Since there is a rest whose attainment is worth all our efforts; since so many have failed of reaching it by their unbelief, and since there is so much danger that we may fail of it also, let us give all diligence that we may enter into it. Heaven is never obtained but by diligence; and no one enters there who does not earnestly desire it, and who does not make a sincere effort to reach it.

#### v.12
>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

“It is alive in every part, and in every part keen to cut the conscience, and wound the heart. Depend upon it, **there is not a superfluous verse in the Bible, nor a chapter which is useless.**” (Spurgeon)

This reminds me of the night I read Ecclesiastes 3 while staying over at Paul Bae's house. The book that seems to provoke my cynicism cut through any disillusion that could have arisen in that situation. Surely, not one verse is wasted. It cuts both ways.

Thus, many men seem to preach. Yet for aught that appears, **truth is just as wisely adapted to save the soul as medicine is to heal the sick;** and why then should not a preacher be as careful to study the nature of truth and its adaptedness to a particular end, as a student of the healing art is to understand the adaptedness of medicine to cure disease? The true way of preaching is, to feel that truth is adapted to the end in view; to select what is best suited for that end; to preach as if the whole result depended on getting that truth before the mind and into the heart - and then to leave the whole result with God - **as a physician with right feelings will exert all his skill to save his patient, and then commit the whole question of life and health to God. He will be more likely to praise God intelligently** who believes that he has wisely adapted a plan to the end in view, than he who believes that God works only at random.

The point here is not an analysis of human nature, but that the **Word searches the heart in such detail that it is like a sharp sword** that divides even what is virtually (but not absolutely) indivisible, whether soul and spirit or joints and marrow.

#### v.13
>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

 There is no being who is not wholly known to God. All his thoughts, feelings, plans, are distinctly understood.

#### v.16
>Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

Connected to [[grace]].

Ancient Jewish Rabbis taught that God had two thrones, one of mercy and one of judgment. They said this because they knew that God was both merciful and just, but they could not reconcile these two attributes of God. They thought that perhaps God had two thrones to display the two aspects of His character. On one throne He showed judgment and on the other throne mercy. But here, in light of the finished work of Jesus, **we see mercy and judgment reconciled into one throne of grace.**
