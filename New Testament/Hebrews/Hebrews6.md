# Hebrews 6

## Overview:
The author continues to warn his audience on becoming mature in Christ. He warns that those who have experienced much of God and falls away cannot come back. Yet, his audience indeed are truly saved adn encourages them to have hope and be encouraged by Abraham's faith and patience. 


#### v.1-2
>Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, <sup>2</sup>instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgement.

“When we consider the ‘rudiments’ one by one, it is remarkable how little in the list is distinctive of Christianity, for practically every item could have its place in a fairly orthodox Jewish community… Each of them, indeed, acquires a new significance in a Christian context; but the impression we get is that **existing Jewish beliefs and practices were used as a foundation on which to build Christian truth**.” (Bruce)

They had to get past the basics to biblical maturity (5:11-14), or they would fall away (6:4-8). The writer probably chooses these items as the “basics” because they were the basic sort of instructions about Jewish belief given to converts to Judaism, which all the author’s readers would have understood before becoming followers of Jesus. These items represented Jewish teachings still useful for followers of Christ. Judaism stressed \*repentance as a regular antidote for sin, and a once-for-all kind of repentance for the turning of pagans to Judaism; Judaism naturally stressed faith as well. Although “dead” works could echo the common Jewish denunciation of idols as dead, that specific an allusion is unlikely in this context; cf. 9:14.

Corey Russell's story of Bob Jones. Witchcraft makes you forget fruit from your previous seasons and blinds you from believing you'll bear fruit in any future season.

#### v.18
>God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us **may be greatly encouraged**.

We are encouraged by His promises and his character.

The strongest of which the mind can conceive. The consolation of a Christian is not in his own strength; his hope of heaven is not in any reliance on his own powers. His comfort is, that God has “promised” eternal life to his people, and that He cannot prove false to his word; [Titus 1:2](Titus1#v.2).

>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
