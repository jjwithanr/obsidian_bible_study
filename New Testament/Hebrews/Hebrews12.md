# Hebrews 12

## Overview:
The author encourages his audience by urging them to throw everything that is hindering them by realizing they are surrounded by all those great men of faith from chapter 11. Even in God's discipline there is much to be encouraged by. True sons of God endure his discipline and ought to live in peace with another. Lastly, he compares Mount Sinai, where Moses and Israelites approached with much fear and trembling, to Mount Zion, which the author describes with thousands of angels in joyful asssembly. His conclusion is that we give God acceptable worship.


#### v.1
>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and **let us run** with persevearance the race marked out for us.

He stands with us at the starting-point, and earnestly says to us, not ‘Run,’ but, ‘Let us run.’ The apostle himself is at our side as a runner.

**Endurance** is needed to run that race. **Endurance** translates the ancient Greek word _hupomone_, “which does not mean the patience which sits down and accepts things but the patience which masters them… It is a determination, unhurrying and yet undelaying, which goes steadily on and refuses to be deflected.” (Barclay)

#### v.2
>Let us [fix our eyes on Jesus](Hebrews11#v.27), the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, **scorning its shame**, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

The Greek word for ‘looking’ is a much fuller word than we can find in the English language. It has a preposition in it which turns the look away from everything else. You are to look from all beside to Jesus. Fix not thy gaze upon the cloud of witnesses; they will hinder thee if they take away thine eye from Jesus. Look not on the weights and the besetting sin-these thou hast laid aside; look away from them. Do not even look upon the race-course, or the competitors, but look to Jesus and so start in the race.

Shame is a significant trial. [Daniel 12:2](Daniel12#v.2) says that shame will be an aspect of the terrors of hell: _And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt_. Jesus bore this hellish shame to accomplish our redemption.

#### v.3
>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

The best means of leading a faithful Christian life amidst the opposition which we may encounter, is to keep the eye steadily fixed on the Saviour.

#### v.5-6
>And **you have forgotten** that word encouragement that addresses you as sons:
  "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,
  and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
 <sup>6</sup>because the Lord disciplines those he loves,
  and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son."

Same as [Proverbs 3:11-12](Proverbs3#v.11-12).
 Much difficulty in the Christian life comes from those three words: **you have forgotten**. Perhaps it is some principle we remember in the mind, but **have forgotten** in the heart – and we must remember it again.

 Connects to [Hebrews 3:1](Hebrews3#v.1) where the author urges his brothers in Christ to fix their thoughts on Jesus. Keep Him at the forefront of your mind that you may not be unaware of both his discipline and encouragements.

#### v.10
>Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, **that we may share in his holiness**.

To be holy as God is holy; to be so holy that it may be said that we “are partakers of his holiness,” is a richer blessing than health, and property, and friends, without it; and when by the exchange of the one we acquire the other, **we have secured infinitely more than we have lost.** To obtain the greater good we should be willing to part with the less; to secure the everlasting friendship and favour of God we should be willing, if necessary, to surrender the last farthing of our property;** the last friend that is left us**; the last feeble and fluttering pulsation of life in our veins.

#### v.11
>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

There is no Christian who is not ultimately benefited by trials, and who is not able at some period subsequently to say, **“It was good for me that I was afflicted. Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.”** When a Christian comes to die, he does not feel that he has had one trial too many, or one which he did not deserve. He can then look back and see the effect of some early trial so severe that he once thought he could hardly endure it, spreading a hallowed influence over his future years, and scattering its golden fruit all along the pathway of life. I have never known a Christian who was not benefited by afflictions; I have seen none who was not able to say that his trials produced some happy effect on his religious character, and on his real happiness in life. If this be so, then no matter how severe our trials, we should submit to them without a complaint. **The more severe they are, the more we shall yet be blessed - on earth or in heaven.**

#### v.14
>Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.

Spurgeon described four types of people who try to get on without holiness:

· The _Pharisee_: Confident in outward ceremonies instead of true holiness.

· The _moralist_: Feels no need for holiness because his life is so good.

· The _experimentalist_: Their entire Christian life is lived inward, never looking to outward conduct but only to feelings.

· The _opinionist_: Their Christian life is all about believing the right doctrines and is unconcerned about the way one lives.

#### v.15
>See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter [root](Deuteronomy29#v.18) grows up to cause trouble and defile many.

#### v.18-19
>You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm; <sup>19</sup>to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,

#### v.24
>to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.

The meaning here is, that the blood of Jesus speaks better things than Abel did; that is, that the blood of Jesus is the “reality” of which the offering of Abel was a “type.” Abel proclaimed by the sacrifice which he made the great truth that salvation could be only by a bloody offering - but he did this only in a typical and obscure manner; Jesus proclaimed it in a more distinct and better manner by the reality. The object here is to compare the Redeemer with Abel, not in the sense that the blood shed in either case calls for vengeance, but that salvation by blood is more clearly revealed in the Christian plan than in the ancient history; and hence illustrating, in accordance with the design of this Epistle, the superior excellency of the Christian scheme over all which had preceded it.

#### v.28-29
>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, <sup>29</sup>for our "God is a consuming fire."

This is a further reason why we should serve God with profound reverence and unwavering fidelity. The quotation is made from [Deuteronomy 4:24](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=de+4:24&t1=eng_nas&sr=1). “For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” The object of the apostle here seems to be, to show that there was the same reason for fearing the displeasure of God under the new dispensation which there was under the old. It was the same God who was served. There had been no change in his attributes, or in the principles of his government. He was no more the friend of sin now than he was then; and the same perfections of his nature which would then lead him to punish transgression would also lead him to do it now. His anger was really as terrible, and as much to be dreaded as it was at Mount Sinai; and the destruction which he would inflict on his foes would be as terrible now as it was then.
