# Hebrews 2

## Overview:
After conveying the deity of Jesus Christ to his audience, the author urges them to pay attention to the gospel that was preached to them. Although Jesus is fully god, he subjected himself to that of a man to share in the sufferring of the human nature. 


#### v.1
>We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.

It needs not great sins to destroy the soul. Simple “neglect” will do it as certainly as atrocious crimes. Every person has a sinful heart that will destroy him unless he makes an effort to be saved; and it is not merely the great sinner, therefore, who is in danger. It is the man who “neglects” his soul - whether a moral or an immoral man - a daughter of amiableness, or a daughter of vanity and vice.

#### v.3-4
>how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. <sup>4</sup>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.

**“Neglect” is enough to ruin a man.** A man who is in business need not commit forgery or robbery to ruin himself; he has only to “neglect” his business, and his ruin is certain. A man who is lying on a bed of sickness, need not cut his throat to destroy himself; he has only to “neglect” the means of restoration, and he will be ruined. A man floating in a skiff above Niagara, need not move an oar or make an effort to destroy himself; he has only to “neglect” using the oar at the proper time, and he will certainly be carried over the cataract. Most of the calamities of life are caused by simple “neglect.” By neglect of education children grow up in ignorance; by neglect a farm grows up to weeds and briars; by neglect a house goes to decay; by neglect of sowing, a man will have no harvest; by neglect of reaping, the harvest would rot in the fields. No worldly interest can prosper where there is neglect; and why may it not be so in religion? There is nothing in earthly affairs that is valuable that will not be ruined if it is not attended to - and why may it not be so with the concerns of the soul? Let no one infer, therefore, that because he is not a drunkard, or an adulterer, or a murderer, that, therefore, he will be saved. Such an inference would be as irrational as it would be for a man to infer that because he is not a murderer his farm will produce a harvest, or that because he is not an adulterer therefore his merchandise will take care of itself. **Salvation would be worth nothing if it cost no effort - and there will be no salvation where no effort is put forth.**

#### v.9
>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.

*check for Spurgeon sermon*
**In Jewish thought, angels ruled the nations in this age.** Jesus had obviously been made lower than God and the angels, but after death he was crowned with glory (1:13); therefore this text was not only true of the past Adam and God’s people in the future but also had been fulfilled in Jesus. (The author may read “a little lower” as “for a little while lower,” which was an acceptable way to read the lxx of Ps 8; he also distinguishes “a little lower” from “crowned with honor,” though the lines are parallel in Hebrew. Ancient Jewish interpreters generally read passages whatever way fit best with their views.)
