# Colossians 3

## Overview:
After establishing the true nature of Christ and the riches of knowing Him, Paul lays out what a life lived worthy of such a manner looks like. His instructions aren't just mere rules and suggestions; rather, they're lifestyles inspired and breathed by the Holy Spirit.


#### v.2
>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.

Since we are raised from the death of sin, and are made to live anew, the great object of our contemplation should be the heavenly world.

#### v.3
>For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.

#### v.5
>Put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earhtly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.

#### v.6
>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.

#### v.8
>But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.

The Christian must be very aware of the words that come out of their mouths. Speech and conduct is to be watched closely ([James 3:6](James3#v.6), [Proverbs 10:19](Proverbs10.md#v.19), etc.)

#### v.10
>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.

But especially had he that knowledge which is the fear of the Lord; that knowledge of God which is the result of love. Piety, in the Scriptures, is often represented as the "knowledge" of God; see the notes at [John 17:3](John17#v.3); compare the notes at [Ephesians 3:19](Ephesians3#v.19).

#### v.12
>Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.


#### v.13
>Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

#### v.14
>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.

#### v.15
>Let the word of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.

Preside in your hearts; sit as umpire there (Doddridge); govern and control you. The word rendered here "rule" - βραβεύετω brabeuetō - is commonly used in reference to the Olympic and other games. It means, to be a director, or arbiter of the public games; to preside over them and preserve order, and to distribute the prizes to the victors. The meaning here is, that the peace which God gives to the soul is to be to us what the brabeutes, or governor at the games was to those who contended there. **It is to preside over and govern the mind; to preserve every thing in its place; and to save it from tumult, disorder, and irregularity.** The thought is a very beautiful one. The soul is liable to the agitations of passion and excitement - like an assembled multitude of men. It needs something to preside over it, and keep its various faculties in place and order; and nothing is so well fitted to do this as the calm peace which religion gives, a deep sense of the presence of God, the desire and the evidence of his friendship, the hope of his favor, and the belief that he has forgiven all our sins. **The "peace of God" will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul;** subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order - as a ruler sways and controls the passions of assembled multitudes of people.

#### v.16
>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.

Whereas Ephesians 5:18-19 emphasizes the Spirit in worship, Paul in Colossians is **concerned with erring persons who have not recognized the full sufficiency of Christ;** he thus emphasizes the “word of Christ” here. On the worship, see comment on Ephesians 5:19

We need sound theology when we worship God.

#### v.17
>And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

When I started using my phone during my internship, I got convicted that my work ethic isn't invisible to God in non-spiritual contexts. No, we are to do everything in the name of Jesus always giving thanks.
#jj struggle is real.

#### v.23
>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,

#### v.25
>Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favortism.

This is a more description of favoritsm to God. It's not that He is unable to show favor but that He consistent in His judgements.
