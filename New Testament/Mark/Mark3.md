# Mark 3

## Overview:



#### v.5
>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.

Heart similar to [Hebrews 3:7](Hebrews3#v.7). See how our Savior longs to comfort and amaze our hearts lest it not be hardened.

#### v.18
>Andrew, Philip, Barthelomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot

#### v.21
>And when His own people heard _this_, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He has lost His senses.”

The reason why this report gained any belief was, probably, that he had lived among them as a carpenter; that he was poor and unknown; and that now, at 30 years of age, he broke off from his occupations, abandoned his common employment, spent much time in the deserts, denied himself the common comforts of life, and set up his claims to be the Messiah who was expected by all the people to come with great pomp and splendor.

Let a man be made **deeply sensible of his sins**, and **spend much of his time in prayer**, and **have no relish for the ordinary amusements or business of life**; or let a Christian be much impressed with his obligation to devote himself to God, and "act" as if he believed there was an "eternity," and warn his neighbors of their danger; or **let a minister show uncommon zeal and spend his strength in the service of his Master**, and the world is not slow to call it derangement.

#### v.35
>Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."

Obedience to Him is the first and main thing to which everything else bows, and which determines everything. If others compete or interfere, reject them.
