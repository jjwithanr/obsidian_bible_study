# Mark 10

## Overview:


#### v.14
>When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."

The Greek shows that there was no interval between the acts of the parents and the disciples, and our Lord's seeing it. The parents were bringing the children, the disciples were rebuking them, Jesus was perceiving. He was much displeased (ἠγανάκτησε); literally, he was moved with indignation. His words imply eagerness and earnestness: Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not. The copulative καὶ is not to be found in the best authorities. The omission adds force and vividness to the words. The simplicity, candour, and innocence of little children are very attractive. This narrative shows with what care children should be educated.

Jesus rebukes anything that will mitigate joyful procession into His presence - even His own disciples.

#### v.15
>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."

#### v.16
>And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.

"Think of me."

If God be not their friend, they "have" no friend that can aid them in the day of adversity, or keep them from the snares of the destroyer. If he is their friend they have nothing to fear.

We must first receive the kingdom into our affections before we can really enter into it. It is as though Christ said, "It is not unworthy of my dignity to take little children into my arms and bless them, because by my benediction they become fit for the kingdom of heaven. And if you full-grown men would become fit for my kingdom, you must give up your ambitious aims and earthly contests, and imitate the simple unworldly ways of little children. The simplicity of the little child is the model and the rule for every one who desires, by the grace of Christ, to obtain the kingdom of heaven. Our Lord's whole action here is a great encouragement to the receiving of little children by Holy Baptism into covenant with him.

#### v.21
>Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."

His gaze and love strengthens and supplies the revelation of our own lack that all we have would belong to Him.

Grotius remarks: Jesus loved not virtues only, but seeds of virtues (“et semina virtutum”).

#### v.44
>and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.

Greatness and authority is given to the slave of all.

#### v.45
>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

Philosopher William Jamees affirmed that the best use of one's life is to spend it for something that will outlast it. Life's value is not its duration but its donation - not how long we live but how fully and how well.

#### v.46
>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Baritmaeus (That is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.

Nothing happened in Jericho. Jesus can walk into a city and nothing happen. **And the only man that saw Jesus was a blind man.**
Here's my definition of hunger: the revelation of your need.

#### v.48
>Many rebuked him and told to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"

The revealtion of our need for Christ must exceed the world's need for us to be like them.

#### v.49
>Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."

Oh, how great is the heart of the Father whose eyes range throughout the earth to strenghthen those whose hearts are completely His! He yearns make to eye contact with those whose hearts yearn for him, and the only pair of eyes He found were blind to the world and directed to the Savior.
#jj 

#### v.51
>"What do you want me do for you?" Jesus asked him.

Jesus exemplifies his servanthood by his first response inquiring His service to the blind man who called out to me. Kay Hiramine says the distinction between an empire-minded man and a kingdom-minded man is whom they desire to serve: themselves or others. If someone's heart first thinks of how the person in front of them can serve himself, he is building his own empire. Oh, that we may emulate our Savior and gives our lives in servitude of many.
