# James 5

## Overview:

#### v.1
>Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you.

Hard Sayings of the Bible lays out the context for the *rich people* James says here: they are not believers, they will be judged for failing to obey the gospel, they have practiced injustice, they have been self-indulgent, and they have oppressed the righteous.

#### v.7-8
>Be patient, then, brothers, until the Lord's coming, See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. <sup>8</sup>You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.

Souls may not be won to God the first time you pray for them, nor the first time you exhort them, nay, nor the twentieth time. If you have gone to a sinner once on Christ’s errand, and he has rejected you, go again seven times. Nay, go again seventy times seven. For if you should at last succeed by your Master’s gracious help, it will well repay you. The long, tedious winter of your waiting will appear as a short span to look back upon when you have reaped the field of your labor. The little patience that you had to exert for a while will seem as nothing, like the travail of the mother when the man-child is born into the world. Hush, then, your sad complaints, and still your petulant wailings.

#### v.9
>Don't grumble against each other, brothers, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!

The exact idea here is, not that of grudging in the sense of dissatisfaction with what others possess, or of being envious; it is that of being fretful and impatient - or, to use a common word which more exactly expresses the sense that of grumbling. This may arise from many causes; either because others have advantages which we have not, and we are discontented and unhappy, as if it were wrong in them to have such enjoyments; or because we, without reason, suppose they intend to slight and neglect us; or because we are ready to take offence at any little thing, and to “pick a quarrel” with them.

#### v.11
>As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverence and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.



#### v.13
>Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise.

#### v.16
>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

If you sin secretly, confess secretly, admitting publicly that you need the victory but keeping details to yourself. If you sin openly confess openly to remove stumbling blocks from those whom you have hindered. **If you have sinned spiritually** (prayerlessness, lovelessness, and unbelief as well as their offspring, criticism, etc.) **then confess to the church that you have been a hindrance.**

Nothing has been more clearly demonstrated in the history of the world than that prayer is effectual in obtaining blessings from God, and in accomplishing great and valuable purposes. It has indeed no intrinsic power; but God has graciously purposed that his favor shall be granted to those who call upon him, and that what no mere human power can effect should be produced by his power in answer to prayer.

#### v.17
>Elijah was man just like us. **He prayed earnestly** that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.

“He prayed with prayer” - a Hebraism, to denote that he prayed earnestly. Compare [Luke 22:15](Luke22#v.15). This manner of speaking is common in Hebrew.


#### v.19-20
>My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, <sup>20</sup>remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover a multitude of sins.
