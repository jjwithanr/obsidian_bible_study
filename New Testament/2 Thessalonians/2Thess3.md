# 2 Thessalonians 3

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.

The prayer request that God’s word may “run” (literally) or “spread” swiftly probably borrows the image from Psalm 147:15. The Thessalonians would think of runners in an athletic competition.

I remember praying this for Jenn Son while she was in E-land.

#### v.2
>And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.

The connection seems to require us to understand it as meaning that **all people are not prepared to embrace the gospel.** Hence, they set themselves against it, and from such people Paul prayed that he might be delivered; compare [2 Timothy 3:8](2Timothy3#v.8). The state of mind in which the apostle was when he wrote this, seems to have been this: **He recollected the readiness with which the Thessalonians had embraced the gospel, and the firmness with which they held it, and seems to suppose that they would imagine the same thing must be found true everywhere.** But he says all people have not the same faith; all were not prepared cordially and fully to embrace the gospel. There were unreasonable and wicked people whom he had encountered, from whom he prayed that he might be delivered.

#### v.3
>But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.

See more in [[edward#Barnes on 2 Thessalonians 3 3 2Thess3 v 3]].

#### v.5
> May the Lord **direct** your hearts into God's love and Christ's persevearance.

See more in [[alone#Spurgeon on 2 Thessalonians 3 5 2Thess3 v 5]].

#### v.6
>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.

The origin of this group of idlers in the \*church **might be the Greco-Roman aristocratic disdain for manual labor, or \*clients or parasites dependent on wealthier \*patrons,** or a mistaken belief that the day of the Lord had come and canceled the need for such labor (2:2). Alternatively, they may have pursued a philosophic, specifically a \*Cynic, lifestyle (see comment on 3:11-12). More certainly, idlers were known to pass their days in the marketplaces of Greek cities (including Thessalonica—Acts 17:5), sometimes easily stirred by demagogues. Some may have been genuinely converted but not given up their previous lifestyle

There seems no reason, however, to doubt that it was much increased by **their expectation that the Saviour would soon appear, and that the world would soon come to an end. If this was to be so, of what use would it be to labor?** Why strive to accumulate property with reference to the wants of a family, or to a day of sickness, or old age? Why should a man build a house that was soon to be burnt up, or why buy a farm which he was soon to leave? The effect of the expectation of the speedy appearing of the Lord Jesus has always been to induce men to neglect their worldly affairs, and to lead idle lives. Man, naturally disposed to be idle, wants the stimulus of hope that he is laboring for the future welfare of himself, for his family, or for society, nor will he labor if he believes that the Saviour is about to appear.

Many question the path God has put them on to be diligent employee or student. We must avoid the temptation to be idle when we hear Fred Market's teachings on geopolitical conflict. If the revelation that world war is at hand, let alone the second return of Christ, makes us idle, our fleshly desire for material gain is exposed. We work unto the Lord and unto Him alone.

Cults believe Jesus has already returned which drives them to lead ascetic, isolated lifestyles. See how the Holy Spirit speaks through His servant Paul. In the name of Jesus, avoid such people! See idleness and the reasonings promoting it has led many astray!

#### v.10
>For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: "If a man will not work, he shall not eat."

#### v.12
>Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.

Some Christians may have decided to justify their idleness by citing the lifestyle of traveling sages, such as Paul and his companions. But although Paul and his companions had distinguished themselves from the “bad” Cynic philosophers (see comment on 1 Thess 2:1-12), some Thessalonians may have continued fully in the Cynic vein: unlike Paul, Cynics begged rather than worked; and with their denunciations of passersby they were certainly “meddlers.”

Biblical support for capitalism?

>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
