# 1 John 1

## Overview:


#### v.3
>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

#### v.7
>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have **fellowship with one another**, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from **all sin**.

We would have expected John to say, “We have fellowship with God.” That is true, but already in the idea of walking together with God in the light. John wants to make it clear that fellow Christians who walk in the light enjoy fellowship with each other.
This leads to an important idea: if we do _not_ **have fellowship with one another**, then one party or both parties are not walking **in the light**. Two Christians who are in right relationship with God will also naturally be in right relationship with each other.

We can be cleansed, by the blood of Jesus, from **all sin**. The sin we inherited from Adam, the sin we committed as kids, the sins of our growing up; sins against our father, against our mother, against our brother and sister; sins against our husbands or wives, against our children; sins against our employers or our employees, sins against our friends and our enemies; lying, stealing, cheating, adultery, swearing, drugs, booze, promiscuity, murder; sins that haunt us every day, sins we didn’t even know we did – **all sin** can be cleansed by the blood of Jesus.

#### v.9
>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.

Our sins are not forgiven _because_ we confess... However, confession is still vital to maintain _relationship_ with God, and this is the context John speaks from. As God convicts us of sin that is hindering our fellowship with Him, we must confess it and receive forgiveness and cleansing for our relationship with God to continue without hindrance.

#### v.10
>If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.

“No man was ever kept out of God’s kingdom for his confessed badness; many are for their supposed goodness.” (Trapp)
