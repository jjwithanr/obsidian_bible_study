### Spurgeon on [Psalm 73:24](Psalm73#v.24)
[Sermon link](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs2389.pdf)
Haste too, is the author of a great deal of mischief in human life. Men are in such a hurry that they make all manner of mistakes, but the habit of praying about everything is in itself a great guide. You have to stop a while, and the very stopping lets you see more than you would have seen in your hurry. The habit of praying before you leap leads to the habit of looking before you leap, and then, when you perceive that you cannot leap, prayer gives you enough of prudence to resolve that you will go round some other way. Thus you are wisely guided in life.

Above all, the grace of God guides us very much by the dethroning of self as the traitorous lord of our being, and makes us loyal to Christ. When a man acts out of loyalty to Christ, he is pretty sure to act very wisely and rightly. On this point alone I should have liked to have had an hour’s talk with you, but I must draw my remarks to a close. 

I believe that, over and above this infusion of right principles, and balancing of the faculties, there is a special illumination of mind which comes from dwelling near God. Everybody knows how near akin sin is to insanity. Well now, remember that holiness is as near akin to perfect wisdom as sin is to insanity, and when you yield yourself to the holy influences of God’s presence, you shall have given to you what men call “shrewd commonsense,” but what is really an illumination produced in your mind by getting near to God and being made like Him.
