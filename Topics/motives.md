### [1 Thessalonians 2:3](1Thess2#v.3)

### [James 4](James4)
In the preceding verses, we discover that the readers hav een using two means to get what they want. First, they struggle with each other, perhaps including vying for power within the Christian community. Second, they pray. But, adds James, they receive no answer to their prayers. This is becaues they are **trying to use God to gain their own ends.** God becomes the "sugar daddy" to fulfill their desires, but it is desire, not God, that they are really serving. Both strategies, that of struggle and that of manipulative prayer, show that they are invested in the world.

### Spurgeon on [praying in the Spirit](Jude#v.20)
[Sermon link](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs719.pdf)
Does not God abhor the sacrifice where the heart is not found? It would be an unholy thing if we had increased our sins by our prayers. It would be a very unhappy fact if it should turn out that when we have bowed the knee in what we thought to be the service of God, we were actually insulting the God of heaven by uttering words which could not but be disgusting to Him because our hearts did not go with our lips. Let us rest assured that if for seventy years we have punctually performed our devotions by the use of the book, or of the form which we have learned, we may the whole seventy years never once have prayed at all, and the whole of that period we may have been living in Godâ€™s esteem an ungodly, prayerless life, because we have never worshipped God, who is a Spirit, in spirit and in truth, and have never prayed in the Holy Ghost. Judge yourselves, brethren, that you be not judged.

### Barnes on [Matthew 18](Matthew18)

1. We see that it is possible to make a profession of religion an occasion of ambition... There are few paths to the confidence of mankind so easily trod as to enter the ministry. Every minister, of course, if at all worthy of his office, has access to the confidence of multitudes, and is never despised but by the worst and lowest of mankind. No way is so easy to step at once to public confidence. Other people toil long to establish influence by personal character. The minister has it by virtue of his office. Those who now enter the ministry are tempted far more in this respect than were the apostles; and how should they search their own hearts, to see that no such abominable motive has induced them to seek that office!
2. It is consummate wickedness thus to prostitute the most sacred of all offices to the worst of purposes. The apostles at this time were ignorant. They expected a kingdom in which it would be right to seek distinction. But we labor under no such ignorance. We know that the kingdom of Christ is not of this world, and woe to the man that acts as though it were. Deep and awful must be the doom of him who thus seeks the honors of the world while he is professedly following the meek and lowly Jesus!
3. Humility is indispensable to religion, [Matthew 18:3](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm). No man who is not humble can possibly be a Christian. He must be willing to esteem himself as he is, and to have others esteem him so also. **This is humility, and humility is lovely. It is not meanness it is not cowardice - it is not want of proper self-esteem; it is a view of ourselves just as we are, and a willingness that God and all creatures should so esteem us.**
4. Humility is the best evidence of piety, [Matthew 18:4](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-4.htm). The most humble man is the most eminent Christian. He is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. The effect of sin is to produce pride. Religion overcomes it by producing a just sense of ourselves, of other people, of angels, and of God. We may therefore measure the advance of piety in our own souls by the increase of humility.
5. We see the danger of despising and doing injury to real Christians, and more especially the guilt of attempting to draw them into sin, [Matthew 18:6](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-6.htm). God watches over them. He loves them. In the eye of the world they may be of little importance, but not so with God. The most obscure follower of Christ is dear, infinitely dear, to him, and he will take care of him. He that attempts to injure a Christian, attempts to injure God; for God has redeemed him, and loves him.
