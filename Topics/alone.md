### Spurgeon on [2 Thessalonians 3:5](2Thess3#v.5)
[Article link](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs2028.pdf)

Well, now, concerning love to God; if you receive it fully into your souls *it will nourish the contemplative life.* You will want to be alone. You will prefer to sit silently at Jesus‚Äô feet, while others wrangle over the little politics of the house. You will give up being busy-bodies, talking in six peoples‚Äô houses in an hour; quietude will charm you. You will love no company as much as the society of Him who is the Best and the Most. To be with God in quiet will be your highest enjoyment. You will not say, as some do, ‚ÄúI must have recreation.‚Äù **Contemplation of God is recreation to the child of God. It creates the soul anew, and is not this the truest re-creation?üî•** Whenever God‚Äôs creation in us seems to have grown a little dim, love to God will gender and nourish the contemplative life, and so make us come forth as new creatures, fresh from our Maker‚Äôs holy hand.

*It will also animate the active life if you love God.* You will feel that you must yield fruit unto your Lord. Your soul, when full of the love of God, will cry, ‚ÄúI must go after the wanderer, I must care for the poor, I must teach the ignorant.‚Äù **You cannot love God and be lazy.** Love to God will stir you up. Contemplation teaches you to sit still, and this is no trifling lesson, but after sitting still, you rise with greater energy to go about the one thing needful, namely, the service of your Lord‚Äôs love.

### Barnes on [2 Timothy 1:15](2Timothy1#v.15)
1. A holy man imprisoned and about to die. He had nearly finished his course, and had the prospect of soon departing.

1. He was forsaken by his friends, and left to bear his sorrows alone. They on whom he might have relied, had left him; and to all his outward sufferings, there was added this, one of the keenest which his Master endured before him, that his friends forsook him, and left him to bear his sorrows alone.

1. Yet his mind is calm, and his faith in the gospel is unshaken. He expresses no regret that he had embraced the gospel; no sorrow that he had been so zealous in it as to bring these calamities upon himself. That gospel he still loves, and his great solicitude is, that his young friend may never shrink from avowing it, though it may call him also to pass through scenes of persecution and sorrow.

1. In the general apostasy, the turning away of those on whom he might have relied, it is refreshing and interesting, to find mention made of one unshaken friend; [2 Timothy 1:16](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=2ti+1:16&t1=eng_nas&sr=1). He never swerved in his affections. He had been kind to him in former years of comparative honor, and he did not leave him now in the dark day of adversity. It is always interesting to find true friendship in this world - friendship that survives all reverses, and that is willing to manifest itself when the great mass turn coldly away. There is such a thing as friendship, and there is such a thing as religion, and when they meet and mingle in the same heart, the one strengthens the other; and then neither persecution, nor poverty, nor chains, will prevent our doing good to him who is in prison and is about to die; see the notes at [2 Timothy 4:16](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=2ti+4:16&t1=eng_nas&sr=1).

### Robert Murray M'Cheyne on pastoring
M'Cheyne was ever concerned to deepen his ministry by continual study. "Few", says Bonar; have maintained such an "undecaying esteem for the advantages of study." Though always conscious that souls were perishing every day, he never fell into the error of thinking that a minister's main work consists of outward activity. **"The great fault I find with this generation is, they cry that ministers should be more in public ; they think that it is an easy thing to interpret the word of God, and to preach.**

**But a minister's duty is not so much public as private."** Two thick notebooks show that he was constantly storing his mind by reading the Puritans, and Reformers. This emphasis on personal growth he never lost. "Oh," he declared to a friend, "we preachers need to know God in another way than heretofore, in order to speak aright of sin and of salvation. **The work of God would flourish by us, if it flourished more richly in us.**"  
  
"The want of ministerial success," says Robinson, "is a tremendous circumstance, never to be contemplated without horror." Never to rest without success was M'Cheyne's unvarying aim; though from his earliest days at St. Peter's his preaching was attended with saving power, and produced deep convictions and distress in the hearts of many, he and his people ever prayed for further manifestations of God's glory.

### Tozer on loneliness
[Link](https://www.worldinvisible.com/library/tozer/5j00.0010/5j00.0010.39.htm)

His joy is to see his Lord promoted and himself neglected. **He finds few who care to talk about that which is the supreme object of his interest**, so he is often silent and preoccupied in the midst of noisy religious shoptalk. For this he **earns the reputation of being dull and overserious**, so he is avoided and the gulf between him and society widens. He searches for friends upon whose garments he can detect the smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces, and finding few or none he, like Mary of old, **keeps these things in his heart.**

It is this very loneliness that throws him back upon God. "When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up." His inability to find human companionship drives him to seek in God what he can find nowhere else. He learns in inner solitude what he could not have learned in the crowd that Christ is All in All, that He is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption, that in Him we have and possess life's summum bonum.

Two things remain to be said. One, that the lonely man of whom we speak is **not a haughty man**, nor is he the holier-than-thou, austere saint so bitterly satirized in popular literature. He is likely to feel that he is the least of all men and is sure to blame himself for his very loneliness. He wants to share his feelings with others and to open his heart to some like-minded soul who will understand him, but the spiritual climate around him does not encourage it, so he remains silent and tells his griefs to God alone.

The second thing is that the lonely saint is not the withdrawn man who hardens himself against human suffering and spends his days contemplating the heavens. Just the opposite is true. **His loneliness makes him sympathetic to the approach of the broken-hearted and the fallen and the sin-bruised.** Because he is detached from the world he is all the more able to help it. Meister Eckhart taught his followers that if they should find themselves in prayer as it were caught up to the third heavens and happen to remember that a poor widow needed food, they should break off the prayer instantly and go care for the widow. "God will not suffer you to lose anything by it," he told them. "You can take up again in prayer where you left off and the Lord will make it up to you." This is typical of the great mystics and masters of the interior life from Paul to the present day.

The weakness of so many modern Christians is that they feel too much at home in the world. In their effort to achieve restful "adjustment" to unregenerate society they have lost their pilgrim character and become an essential part of the very moral order against which they are sent to protest. **The world recognizes them and accepts them for what they are. And this is the saddest thing that can be said about them. They are not lonely, but neither are they saints.**

### Jonathan on Loneliness
Loneliness is born out the fleshly heart‚Äôs pattern of incorrectly searching to be understood by men and not by God. We place the burden on people to be able to understand the hidden secrets and shape of our hearts. By placing the burden on our friends to fully understand all the deep things inside of us, we naturally begin to feel misunderstood at man‚Äôs deficiency in handling our souls. The reality is that only God the CREATOR of your own heart possesses the deftness to be able to navigate around all the layers we have built up inside. (Psalm 139:1-24, 1 Samuel 16:7) God is the only One who can perform the inside job of searching the crevices of our soul and still be able to say, ‚ÄúYou are my Beloved!‚Äù (Psalm 44:8, Psalm 61:1-3)

Beloved, we are living in a time where I am becoming more and more convinced that we need to welcome wilderness-like seasons that lead us from the herd and to the Shepherd. If you have been struggling with loneliness, here are three practical steps to take NOW:

1.  Go commune with God! Beloved, there is so much to this. We need to understand how important it is that in moments of loneliness, we FLEE to the resting place of God. The cross of Jesus has made an open invitation for you to come before the throne of the Father and encounter the One, True, Living God. (Matthew 5:4)
    
2.  Develop some brotherly/sisterly accountability. If you are feeling lonely but you are not revealing or being vulnerable about this to anyone, then you will stay lonely. Being vulnerable and leaving room for close brothers/sisters to pour into us in times of weakness allows the Holy Spirit more room to increase the measure of His Spirit in us. (Ephesians 1:17-19, 2 Corinthians 12:9, Philippians 3:7-10, John 3:30)
    
3.  Choose joy. I consider this a practical step because the Holy Spirit‚Äôs indwelling in us has now gifted us the grace to resist sin and CHOOSE to walk in the image of His Son. Beloved, we have to choose joy. The devil is on a mission to steal your joy and take away your blessings from you. Choose to have joy and gratitude towards God in the small instances and in the big moments. (Nehemiah 8:10, Romans 15:13)
