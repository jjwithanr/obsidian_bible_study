### Parakaleo vs. Paraklesis
from [[Greek]].
##### parakaléō 
(from [3844](https://biblehub.com/greek/3844.htm) _/pará_, "_from_ close-beside" and [2564](https://biblehub.com/greek/2564.htm) _/kaléō_, "to call") – properly, "make a call" from being "close-up and personal." [3870](https://biblehub.com/greek/3870.htm) _/parakaléō_ ("personally make a call") refers to believers _offering up evidence_ that _stands up in God's court_.
##### paraklésis
properly, a call (urging), done by someone "close beside," i.e. a _personal exhortation_ that delivers the "evidence that stands up in God's court."

3874 (_paráklēsis_) is an "intimate call" that someone personally gives to deliver _God's verdict_, i.e. "the close-call" that reveals how the Lord weighs in the relevant facts (evidence). [3874](https://biblehub.com/greek/3874.htm) _/paráklēsis_ ("holy urging") is used of the Lord directly motivating and inspiring believers to carry out His plan, delivering His particular message to someone else. The core-meaning of [3874](https://biblehub.com/greek/3874.htm) _/paráklēsis_ ("personal urging") is shaped by the individual context, so it can refer to: exhortation, warning, encouragement (comfort), etc.



### Barnes on [Hebrews 3:13](Hebrews3#v.13)
That it is their duty to do it “daily;” that is, constantly; see [Hebrews 10:25](Hebrews10#v.25); [1 Thessalonians 4:18](1Thess4#.v18); [1 Thessalonians 5:11](1Thess5#v.11); note, [Romans 12:8](Romans12#v.8). While this is the special duty of the ministers of the gospel [1 Timothy 6:2](1Timothy6#v.2); [2 Timothy 4:2](2Timothy4#v.2); [Titus 2:6](Titus2#v.6), [Titus 2:15](Titus2#v.15), it is also the duty of all the members of the churches, and a most important, but much-neglected duty.
