### Post-Millennial Hermeneutic

In defense of a spiritualizing hermeneutic of Old Testament texts, post-millennialists offer a biblically based apologetic. They point out that many prophecies concerning Christ's first coming were not fulfilled literally, but in some spiritualized manner (such as Gen 3:15; Mal 45; Is 40:3-5). In fact, it was their expectations of a literal earthly kingdom and political ruler that caused many Jews to fail to recognize Jesus as their Messiah at his first coming. Further, the New Testament itself finds in events surrounding the infant church the fulfillment to certain Old Testament anticipations concerning Israel's future glory (such as Acts 2:16-21; 15:14- 18). Finally, a literal fulfilment of many prophecies would mean a restoration of Jewish national life in a way that would necessitate a return to the old covenant, which, according to the New Testament, has been replaced by the new covenant within the fellowship of the church. The Old Testament prophets, postmillennialists assert, rightly envisioned a glorious era. But because it was yet future, it could only be intelligently described by employing the thought-forms and the religious and political structures with which people of the day were familiar. They readily utilized the vocabulary of the old economy, which focused on the land of Palestine, the temple and the sacrificial system, and the kingship, to speak of the future messianic era they awaited. The prophets, therefore, could only imagine the future age, in which the whole world would worship Yahweh, in terms of the elevation of Jerusalem as the center of worldwide worship and the establishment of the ideal theocracy in Israel as the political center of the earth. In the light of the New Testament, however, we now know that these prophecies are fulfilled in the glorious victory of the church (for example, [Heb 12:18-23](Hebrew12)). Such a heightened, nonliteral fulfillment is in keeping with the nature of prophecy as understood by postmillennialists. Prophecy is not "history written beforehand." Rather, its primary purpose is, in the words of Boettner, "to inspire faith in those who see its fulfillment, and only secondarily to inform us of what is going to happen in the future."? Although it is different from how many people view prophecy, Boettner's understanding can claim New Testament precedence, Peter' epistle declares that the prophets were not cognizant of the object of their vision of the sufferings and glory of Christ, for they were not serving themselves, but the church (1 Pet 1:10-12). In accordance with postmillennial hermeneutics, Boettner interprets Isaiah 2:2-3, for example, as fulfilled

>in that the Gospel took its course out from Jerusalem as the disciples went under orders to evangelize all the world, with the Church over the centuries gradually coming into a position of world-wide prominence, gradually increasing in power and becoming more influential in the lives of men throughout the world until it stands out like a mountain on a plane."

The same hermeneutical approach, however, leads John Jefferson Davis to give the text a yet future referent. To him it speaks of "the latter day spiritual exaltation of the Christian church," at which time the "pervasive impact of the gospel in the life of the nations produces a state of affairs where warfare and the production of its implements cease."89 In either case, postmillennialist exegesis moves from the principle that the church is in some sense the new Israel, "the true Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem." Consequently, the expectations of a glorious future for the nation of Israel envisioned by seers under the old covenant find their fulfillment in the yet future golden age of the church that will culminate the present age of the new covenant (although some postmillennialists also hold out hope for a conversion of Jews in the future)," For this reason, setting forth on a spiritual plane an interpretation of prophecies that by the necessities of the day were limited to a material horizon, postmillennialists conclude, is the only way to understand correctly the intent of the Bible as a whole, of which these texts are a part. Like Augustine in the fifth century, modern postmillennialists argue that to read out of the visions of the Old Testament a literal, physical and political rule of Christ on the earth after the close of the church age, as premillennialists do, is to fall victim to the old tendency to "Judaize" Christianity.
