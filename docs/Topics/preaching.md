# Preaching / Teaching


### Matthew Henry on [1 Timothy 4:11-16](1Timothy4#v.11-14)
> Command and teach these things. Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in **speech**, in **life**, in **love**, in **faith**, and in **purity**. Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scriputre, to preaching and to teaching. *Do not neglect your gift*, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
> Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.

Men's youth will not be despised, if they keep from vanities and follies. Those who teach by their doctrine, **must teach by their life**. Their discourse must be edifying; their conversation must be holy; they must be examples of love to God and all good men, examples of spiritual-mindedness. Ministers must mind these things as their principal work and business. By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well as to all persons; this is the way to profit in knowledge and grace, and also to profit others. The doctrine of a minister of Christ must be scriptural, clear, evangelical, and practical; well stated, explained, defended, and applied. But these duties leave no leisure for worldly pleasures, trifling visits, or idle conversation, and but little for what is mere amusement, and only ornamental. May every believer be enabled to let his profiting appear unto all men; seeking to experience the power of the gospel in his own soul, and to bring forth its fruits in his life.

### Spurgeon on [1 Thessalonians 1:5](1Thess1#v.5)
[Sermon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs648.pdf)

"Degrees of Power Attending the Gospel"
The farmer who labors must himself also first be a partaker of the fruit. Before Ezekiel delivered to the people the prophecies which were written in the roll, the voice came to him, “Son of man, eat this roll,” and he did not only take it into his mouth, where it was like honey for sweetness, but it descended even into his bowels, and mingled with his innermost self. **We must ourselves feel the weight of that burden of the Lord which we proclaim to others**, or we shall not be ministers of the apostolic sort, but rather shall be descendants of the hypocritical Pharisees who bound heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, upon other men’s shoulders, but were not willing to touch them with so much as one of their fingers. The apostle Paul could with peculiar propriety, call the Gospel his own. On the road to Damascus he had singularly experienced its mighty power. And afterwards, in trials oft, in difficulties many, in experiences varied, in temptations furious, he had made each truth of Scripture his own by having tasted its sweetness, handled its strength, proved its comfort, and tried its power. **Do not think of preaching, young man, until you have truth written on your very soul.** As well think of steering the Great Eastern across the ocean without knowing the first principles of navigation. As well think of setting up as an ambassador without your country’s sanction, as to dare to intrude yourself into the Christian ministry unless the Gospel is first your own.  
**No amount of training at Oxford, or Cambridge, or anywhere else, no extent of classical or mathematical teaching can ever make you a minister of Jesus Christ, if you lack the first necessary, namely, a personal interest in salvation by Jesus Christ.** What! Will you profess to be a physician, while the leprosy is on your own brow? Will you attempt to stand between the living and the dead when you are yourself devoid of spiritual life? The priests of old were touched with the blood upon their thumb, the toe, and the ear, to show that they were consecrated everywhere. And none among us must dare to exercise any office for God among His people till first of all we know the cleansing, quickening, refining, sanctifying power of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. It must be our Gospel before we may so much as think of aspiring to the high and holy office of the Gospel ministry.
But this alone is not sufficient. The Christian minister, if he would imitate Paul, must be very careful of his manner of life among the people. **He must be able to say without blushing, “You know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.”** Unselfishness must be our prominent attribute, all must be done for our people’s sake. And then, we must in our lives show the truthfulness of our unselfish professions. O God, how much of grace is wanted that Your servants may be clear of the blood of all men, and make full proof of their ministry. We are not appointed to stand as motionless way-posts to point the way with lifeless accuracy and unsympathizing coldness. This many have done, and while showing the road have never moved one inch in it themselves —such men shall have terrible judgment at the last.

### Spurgeon on [seven stars in Jesus' hand](Revelation1#v.16)

What do you see in Christ’s right hand? Seven stars; yet how insignificant they appear when you get a sight of _his face!_ They are stars, and there are seven of them; but who can see seven stars, or, for the matter of that, seventy thousand stars, when the sun shineth in his strength? How sweet it is, *when the Lord himself is so present in a congregation that the preacher, whoever he may be, is altogether forgotten!* I pray you, dear friends, when you go to a place of worship, **always try to see the Lord’s face rather than the stars in his hand**; look at the sun, and you will forget the stars.

### Spurgeon on preaching with love
[Sermon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs1974.pdf)
My brethren, we that preach the gospel, you that teach it in the Sunday school—you will always find your greatest power to lie in love. There is more eloquence in love than in all the words that the cleverest rhetorician can ever put together. We win upon men not so much by poetry and by artistic wording of sentences, as by the pouring out of a heart’s love that makes them feel that we would save them, that we would bless them, that we would, because we belong to them, regard them as brethren, and play a brother’s part, and lay ourselves out to benefit them.
