# Hope & Disappointments

### Barnes on [Psalm 42:5](Psalm42.md#v.5)

Why art thou cast down, O my soul? - Margin, bowed down. The Hebrew word means to bow down, to incline oneself; then, usually, to prostrate oneself as in public worship; and then, to sink down under the weight of sorrow; to be depressed and sad. The Septuagint renders it, "Why art thou grieved?" - περίλυπος perilupos. So the Vulgate. This is an earnest remonstrance addressed by himself to his own soul, as if there were really no occasion for this excessive depression; as if he cherished his grief improperly. There was a brighter side, and he ought to turn to that, and take a more cheerful view of the matter. He had allowed his mind to rest on the dark side, to look at the discouraging things in his condition. He now felt that this was in some measure voluntary, or had been indulged too freely, and that it was wrong: that it was proper for a man like him to seek for comfort in brighter views; that it was a duty which he owed to himself and to the cause of religion to take brighter views. We may remark,

(1) That there are two sides to the events which occur, and which seem so discouraging to us - a dark side and a bright side.

(2) That in certain states of mind, connected often with a diseased nervous system, we are prone to look only on the dark side, to see only what is gloomy and discouraging.

(3) That this often becomes in a sense voluntary, and that we find a melancholy satisfaction in being miserable, and in making ourselves more unhappy, as if we had been wronged, and as if there were a kind of virtue in dejection and gloom - in "refusing," like Rachel, "to be comforted" [Jeremiah 31:15](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm); perhaps also feeling as if by this we were deserving of the divine approbation, and laying the foundation for some claim to favor on the score of merit.

(4) That in this we are often eminently guilty, as putting away those consolations which God has provided for us; as if a man, under the influence of some morbid feeling, should find a kind of melancholy pleasure in starving himself to death in the midst of a garden full of fruit, or dying of thirst by, the side of a running fountain. And

(5) That it is the duty of the people of God to look at the bright side of things; to think of the past mercies of God; to survey the blessings which surround us still; to look to the future, in this world and the next, with hope; and to come to God, and cast the burden on him. It is a part of religious duty to be cheer ful; and a man may often do more real good by a cheerful and submissive mind in times of affliction, than he could by much active effort in the days of health, plenty, and prosperity. Every sad and desponding Christian ought to say to his soul, "Why art thou thus cast down?"

And why art thou disquieted in me? - Troubled, sad. The word means literally,

(1) to growl as a bear;

(2) to sound, or make a noise, as a harp, rain, waves;

(3) to be agitated, troubled, or anxious in mind: to moan internally. See the notes at [Isaiah 16:11](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm); compare [Jeremiah 48:36](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-36.htm).

Hope thou in God - That is, trust in him, with the hope that he will interpose and restore thee to the privileges and comforts heretofore enjoyed. The soul turns to God when all other hope fails, and finds comfort in the belief that he can and will aid us.

For I shall yet praise him - Margin, give thanks. The idea is, that he would yet have occasion to give him thanks for his merciful interposition. This implies a strong assurance that these troubles would not last always.

For the help of his countenance - literally, "the salvations of his face," or his presence. The original word rendered help is in the plural number, meaning salvations; and the idea in the use of the plural is, that his deliverance would be completed or entire - as if double or manifold. The meaning of the phrase "help of his countenance" or "face," is that God would look favorably or benignly upon him. Favor is expressed in the Scriptures by lifting up the light of the countenance on one. See the notes at [Psalm 4:6](https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm); compare [Psalm 11:7](https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm); [Psalm 21:6](https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-6.htm); [Psalm 44:3](https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm); [Psalm 89:15](https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-15.htm). This closes the first part of the psalm, expressing the confident belief of the psalmist that God would yet interpose, and that his troubles would have an end; reposing entire confidence in God as the only ground of hope; and expressing the feeling that when that confidence exists the soul should not be dejected or cast down.

### Barnes on [Psalm 143:5](Psalm143.md#v.5)

I remember the days of old - Former times.

(1) as contrasted with my present condition.

(2) as times when I called upon thee, and thou didst interpose.

(3) as encouraging me now to come to thee, and spread out my case before thee. See [Psalm 77:5-11](http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-5.htm), note; [Psalm 42:4](http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm), note.

I meditate on all thy works ... - On what thou hast done; on thy gracious interpositions in the time of trial; on the manifestations of thy power in my behalf, and in behalf of thy people. I call all this to mind, remembering that thou art an unchangeable God; that thou hast the same power still; that thou canst interpose now as thou didst then; and that, as an unchangeable God, thou wilt do it in the same circumstances. I, therefore, come to thee, and pray that thou wilt interpose in my behalf

### Spurgeon on [Psalm 131:3](Psalm131.md#v.3)
[Sermon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs1210.pdf)
I have very much to say on this point, but my time is gone. I will only close with the last inquiry, which is this—IS THIS STATE ATTAINABLE? Certainly. David said, “My soul is even as a weaned child.” He did not say that he hoped it would be so. We can surely get where David got, for he was a man of like passions with ourselves...

What is the way to get it? The psalm tells us, “Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and forever.” ***Faith blossoming into hope is the way of sanctification, the road to a calm and quiet spirit.*** You cannot say to yourself, “I will fret no longer,” and then expect never to fret. No, brother, you must expel one affection by another—one propensity must be vanquished by another. **You are too ready to trust in man—trust in God will push out carnal confidence.** You are expecting great things of the world, that is foolish. Expect great things of God, and you will cease from carnal hopes. **You are seeking from day to day for this world’s good, you feel an ambition to rise—seek after the eternal good, and feel an ambition to get nearer to God, and the other ambition will die.**

### N.T. Wright in Paul
“Hope” in this sense is not a feeling. It is a virtue. You have to practice it, like a difficult piece on the violin or a tricky shot at tennis. You practice the virtue of hope through worship and prayer, through invoking the One God, through reading and re-imagining the scriptural story, and through consciously holding the unknown future within the unshakable divine promises.
