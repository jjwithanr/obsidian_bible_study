## Scriptures
[Hebrews 3](Hebrews3)

[Jeremiah 29:10-14](Jeremiah29)

[James 1:20](James1#v.20)


### Intro
Last week we went over "Moving God's heart" following the very first house church where we talked about the greatest commands in the kingdom of heaven.

This week I want to expand on a nuance of loving our neighbors as ourselves. Today, I want to share you a powerful conviction that I've had in my heart for a while now. 

### Elephant
Imagine yourself a large, open-spaced room. You see a huge garage door-like opening in one of the walls and just see the outdoors.

However, only certain things can go through it. In fact, only small cute animals. Imagine some little animals coming in towards you. BUT DON'T LET AN ELEPHANT come into sight. Just don't imagine an elephant AT ALL. Only imagine small little animals coming through that opening.

### Point 1
**Fix your thoughts on Jesus.**

Elephants exist but we entertaining that thought only distracts from what should think of. This is what beholding Jesus means. We become what we behold. John 6:40

This is in response to Hebrews 2:18 which talks about 

Much of our weaknesses, insecurities, and doubts surface in times of adversity and testing. It's our response that matters.

>E + R = 0
>Event + Response = Outcome

### Point 2
**What is your heart's reponse to God's word and his commands?**

Do you put it off for later? Do you cringe in your heart when the Bible's description of being Christian doesn't match your lifestyle? Or do you just not care? Or are you like me, you judge the person talking? LOL

The Bible summarizes some of the above as "hardening your heart". How do we respond in times of adversity where much is out of our control and it doesn't seem our response can change much of the situation?

**Jeremiah 29:10-14**
>This is what the Lord says: "When seventy years are completed for Bablyon, I will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you," declares the Lord, "and will bring you back from captivity.

In times of testing, it's hard to rely on ourselves since our own character is transitioning. Looking within ourselves for wisdom is like standing on a faultline during an earthquake.

Instead, declare God's everlasting character since He is the same forever.

Then seek him with all your heart. The motivation to seek God happens when the revelation of what you were made for collides with where you're at now.

Revelation of our need draws us to pray and revelation of God's character keeps us there.

But this is an individual journey we all have to make in our time with Lord. Only you and God know the compromises and ways you need to grow in.

As a house church community, how do WE respond rightly when there is unbelief among us? In othe words, how we do thrive when things get ROUGH during the school year?

How we do stay solid as a community during the whole school year? It's easy to come and enjoy house church right now when we don't have a pending midterm tomorrow morning. It's easy to worship God when there isn't frustrating house mates or group project members.

### Point 3
**Be an encourager.** Verse 13.

This is the solution. When we fix our thoughts on Jesus and things that praiseworthy as well as respond rightly in our hearts to the Lord, we are then able to encourage others in the way God commands us to.

I hate shallow encouragements. You'll hear many people in university say these kinds of things, "Go off, you." or "You're awesome." Like cool? But anyone can say that.

Encouraging is beyond words. My love language is words, but it can also be *swiping in your house church into the dining hall since they're all stressed from schoolwork* ;)

Notice that the solution to preventing us from a hardened heart corrupted by sinful desires is encouragement. It isn't correction. Correction has its place! Discipline and rebuke shouldn't be ignored in the church!

I think that it could sometimes be our first response when we see weakness in others. We just want to fix them. 

**James 1:20**
>for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.

Also, notice it's not toleration. When we see someone with an unbelieving heart, we can't tolerate that as a community.

We encourage them with the little faith they currently have hoping that, in time, their mustard seed of faith grows up to be a rooted tree that bears much fruit.

### Conclusion
Throughout the rest of this school year, we will dive into other biblical texts that help us retain our focus on these two greatest comtomands. There is so much of the character of God to explore, but I really I want us to never graduate from obeying the two greatest commands God gives us.

So, let's not be like the Israelites, who perished in their unbelief. Let's be a community that maintains a tender heart and encourages one another daily!

### Discussion

Share one strength/positive trait you see for each person in the group.

How have you responded in the past when you weren't solid in the Lord? What needs to change?

What hinders you from encouraging others more often?
