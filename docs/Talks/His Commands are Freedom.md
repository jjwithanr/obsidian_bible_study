# His Commands are Freedom

## Scriptures
[Matthew 11:20-30](Matthew11.md)

[James 1:25](James1#v.25) along with [Hebrews 11:6](Hebrews11#v.6)

[1 John 5:1-5](1John5#v.3)

### Intro
Last week we talked about how we ought to learn from the Israelites' unbelief as a community, and that the solution is to encourage one another.

Did you encourage anyone this past week? Have you fixed your thoughts on Jesus?

Today, I want to break down the nature of God's commands. Often, I find it hard myself to obey God's commands. I shrug, "He's asking too much of me. That's so demanding. Why?" But today, hopefully we'll all come away seeing God's commands as a form of His love towards us.

### Point 1
Why are the unrepentant cities unable to truly know God?
- They're not like little children.

**We receive His commands like little children.**

Reference back to diet Coke story and children vs. orphan spirit.

The unrepentant cities wanted nothing of God's love. They just wanted the Father could give them (miracles), but not the Father himself. It's like if another son complained because he gave his Dad a diet Coke but didn't get the same reaction from him as the first son.

Children are ignorant and simple. Receiving like children means being teachable.

### Point 2
**We obey commands to walk in step with Him**

Weird: I will give you rest. Then He says take my yoke upon yourself and learn from me. That sounds like work!

_Take off that yoke you’re wearing — you don’t need it anymore! Doesn’t that feel great? Now run… be free!_ But Jesus’ solution for yoke-weariness was not to cast off the yoke entirely; it was to yoke ourselves to Him, to walk in step with Him.

Whoever looks back on the plow is unfit for the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus carries most of the weight.

1 John 5:3

### The Purge Example
The Purge takes place in a society where all criminal charges are withheld for one night. Lawlessness ensues on the streets.

### Point 3
**His word is the perfect law that gives freedom.** James 1:25

God's commands are the perfect medium. He isn't a dictator who meticulously refines our lives to only certain behaviors. God allows for creativity and expression with confinements.

[1 Corinthians 6:12-17](1Cor6)
>"Everything is permissible for me" - but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible for me" - but I will not be mastered by anything. Food for the stomach and the stomach for food" - but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in the body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh." But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in the spirit.

### Conclusion
The greatest commands are to love the Lord your God with all your mind, soul, and strength as well as love your neighbor as yourself.

We don't always feel like we should. We know it's the right thing to do.

But now, we know that it is our for own sake we obey Him because it shows our faith is real and shows ourselves how much the Lord cares for us.

### Discussion

What commands from God feel burdensome to you?

Share about something you thought would grant you freedom/happiness/ecstasy but didn't last.

How does knowing God's commands not being burdensome and that He is the giver of true rest change the way you view/approach God?
