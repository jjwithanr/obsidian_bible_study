# 1 Chronicles 29

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Then King David said to the whole assembly: "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the LORD God.

#### v.3-5
>Besides, **in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God**, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple: <sup>4</sup>three thousand talentsÂ of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings, <sup>5</sup>for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. **Now, who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?"**

This amounted to about 110 tons of gold and 260 tons of silver.
The king's appeal for each giver to "consecrate himself" (lit., "to fill his hand"; GK 3338 & 4848) was a technical phrase used to describe ordination to the priesthood; and Scripture, significantly, places the act of giving on the same level of devotion.

#### v.6
>Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.

The weight of gold contributed by David's leaders comes to about 190 tons, and there were about 375 tons of silver.

#### v.9
>The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.

God loves cheerful givers ([2Co 9:7](2Cor9#v.7)).

#### v.12
>Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.

The truth that "everything" we have "comes from" God is the foundation for the doctrine of stewardship. Its basis is this: since our property is his ([Ps 24:1](Psalm24#v.1)), and since we hold it only temporarily and in trust (1Ch 29:15-16), it should therefore be used for him ([Lk 17:10](Luke17#v.10)).

#### v.14
>"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.

#### v.15
>We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.

#### v.16
>O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.

#### v.17
>I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.

#### v.18
>O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.

#### v.22
>They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.

#### v.25
>The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.

#### v.28
>He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.
