# 1 Kings 2

## Overview:


#### v.2-3
>"I am about to go the way of all the earth," he said. "So be strong, show yourself a man, <sup>3</sup>and observe what the Lord your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go,

#### v.9
>But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his grad head down to the grave in blood."

David, as the father of Solomon, speaks wisdom over him before he asks God for wisdom in chapter 3. Fathers know what's in their sons. They call them forth into their destiny and instruct them in the way they should walk in their life.

#### v.27
>So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the Lord, fulfilling the word the Lord has spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.

Being used by God is not just mere ministry activity or outward fruitfulness. It is having the promises of God fulfilled through us in our lives. We know we are obeying God's will when we see His word fulfilled through our lives.

#### v.46b
>The kingdom was now firmly established in Solomon's hands.

This chapter demonstrates that Solomonâ€™s throne was secure at an early date, not like the reign of David or Saul.
