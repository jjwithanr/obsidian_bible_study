# Hosea 4

## Overview:



#### v.7
>They are unfaithful to the Lord; they give birth to illegitimate children. Now their New Moon festivals will devour them and their fields.

#### v.15
>Then I will go back to my place until they admit their guilt. And they will seek my face; in their misery they will earnestly seek me."

Those who are led by severe trials to seek God earnestly and sincerely, will find him a present help and an effectual refuge; for with him is plenteous redemption for all who call upon him. There is solid peace, and there only, where God is.
