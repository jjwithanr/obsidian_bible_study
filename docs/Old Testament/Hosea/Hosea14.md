# Hosea 14

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall!

That simple.
#jj 

#### v.2
>Take words with you and return to the Lord. Say to him: "Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips.

#### v.3
>Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount war-horses. We will never again say 'Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion."

The church may similarly say the same thing! Methods cannot save us! Have compassion on your church, O God.
#jj 

#### v.7-8
>Men will dwell again in his shade. He will flourish like the grain. He will blossom like a vine, and his fame will be like the wine from Lebanon. <sup>8</sup>O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him. I am like a green pine tree; your fruitfulness comes from me."

#### v.9
>Who is wise? He will realize these things. Who is discerning? He will understand them. The ways of the Lord are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.

Lord, would your ways stumble [[edward]] in his rebellion to you. In Jesus' name. Amen.
#jj
