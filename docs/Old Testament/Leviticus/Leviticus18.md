# Leviticus 18

## Overview:


#### v.1
>The LORD said to Moses,

#### v.2
>"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'I am the LORD your God.

#### v.3
>You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices.

#### v.4
>You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the LORD your God.

#### v.5
>Keep my decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them will live by them. I am the LORD.

#### v.6
>"'No one is to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.

#### v.7
>"'Do not dishonor your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; do not have relations with her.

#### v.8
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your father's wife; that would dishonor your father.

#### v.9
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.

#### v.10
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; that would dishonor you.

#### v.11
>"'Do not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father's wife, born to your father; she is your sister.

#### v.12
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your father's sister; she is your father's close relative.

#### v.13
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your mother's sister, because she is your mother's close relative.

#### v.14
>"'Do not dishonor your father's brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations; she is your aunt.

#### v.15
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife; do not have relations with her.

#### v.16
>"'Do not have sexual relations with your brother's wife; that would dishonor your brother.

#### v.17
>"'Do not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. Do not have sexual relations with either her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter; they are her close relatives. That is wickedness.

#### v.18
>"'Do not take your wife's sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living.

Leviticus 18:18 does not imply that a man may marry a second wife so long as she is not a sister to the one he already has. Instead, it prohibits his marrying his wife's sister during the lifetime of his wife, since having her sister as a rival would vex her.
