# Genesis 33

## Overview:


#### v.2
>He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.

He showed his preference for Rachel and Joseph by putting them last.

#### v.4
>But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.

Jacob had expected revenge from Esau, or, if not revenge, then heavy bargaining and appeasement. But, seemingly in response to Jacob's prayer (cf. 32:11), Esau had had a change of heart.

#### v.7
>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.

#### v.8-9
>Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said. <sup>9</sup>But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."

Once again Jacob is portrayed as one who has gone to great lengths to secure his own well-being but whose efforts have proved pointless. Jacob continued to scheme and plan; yet God's own plans ultimately made Jacob's worthless.

#### v.10
>"No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.

#### v.11
>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.
