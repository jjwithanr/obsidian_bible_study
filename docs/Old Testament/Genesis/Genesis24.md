# Genesis 24

## Overview:



#### v.12
>Then he prayed, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

#### v.27
>saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."

#### v.33
>Then the food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say."

Like every true servant of Christ, **he put his masterâ€™s business before his own ease or comfort**; even before the question of necessary food. When a man begins to think more of his eating than of doing the will of God, he ceases to be a true-hearted minister.
