# Genesis 17

## Overview:



#### v.1
>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.

The word **blameless** literally means “whole.” God wanted _all_ of Abram, a total commitment.

#### v.2
>I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers."

All these thirteen years, so far as Scripture informs us, Abram had not a single visit from his God. We do not find any record of his either doing anything memorable or having so much as a single audience with the Most High.

#### v.6
>I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.

#### v.12
>For the generations to come every male among you  who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner - those who are not your offspring.

McMillen also notes newborn children have a peculiar susceptibility to bleeding between the second and fifth days of life. It seems an important blood-clotting agent, vitamin K, is not formed in the normal amount until the fifth to seventh day of life. Another blood-clotting agent, prothrombin, is at its highest levels in infants on precisely the eighth day of life, **making the eighth day the safest, earliest day to circumcise an infant.**

#### v.14
>**Is anything too hard for the Lord?** I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.

**Hard** is the same Hebrew word for _wonderful_ in [Isaiah 9:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+9.6&t=NKJV): _For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given… And His name will be called Wonderful_. Jesus is our “wonderful” One, and He isn’t too **hard** or wonderful for God to give unto us.

#### v.16
>I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
