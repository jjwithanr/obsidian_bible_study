# Genesis 29

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.

Jacob's journey to find a wife was similar to that of Abraham's servant who sought a wife for Isaac. In ch.24 the words of the servant guide the narrative and show that it was God alone who directed him to the right young woman for Isaac. In this chapter Jacob is relatively silent. He does not reflect on God's guidance nor on the Lord's promise to be with him wherever he goes (28:15). It is Jacob's actions, not his words, that tell the story of God's help and guidance.

#### v.2-3
>There he saw a well in the field, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large. <sup>3</sup>When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well's mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.

The description of the size of the rock covering the well and the number of shepherds already on hand hint that Jacob was going to do a mighty deed. Only when all the shepherds are present are the men able to lift the rock from the well and water the flocks, because the rock was big.

The stone served a double function, as a guard against contamination or poisoning of the well and as a social control mechanism, preventing any of the herdsmen in the area from drawing more water than was their right. Apparently water was scarce in this “open country” and thus the right to use the well was a jealously guarded one.

#### v.10-11
>When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle's sheep. <sup>11</sup>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.

 When Jacob saw Rachel, however, and the shepherds identified her as the daughter of Laban, he single-handedly removed the rock and watered her sheep. Then, in a great show of emotion, Jacob kissed Rachel and cried with a loud voice. Clearly Jacob saw in these circumstances the guiding hand of God (cf. 24:27). Jacob's physical strength was perhaps meant as further evidence that God was with him and that he had not forsaken his promises (28:15; cf. 24:27).

#### v.17
>Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely in form, and beautiful.

In the comparative description of Rachel and Leah, the only comment about Leah concerns her eyes. The term used is generally considered positive and speaks of fragility, vulnerability, tenderness or a delicate quality (NIV note). Although eyes were a principal component of beauty in the ancient world, Leah’s positive features paled in comparison to Rachel’s loveliness.

#### v.25-26
>When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?" <sup>26</sup>Laban replied, "It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.

For the first time Jacob was the object of deception. Laban turned the tables on him. In the case of the blessing (v.27), Jacob was able to exchange the younger for the older, whereas here Laban reversed the trick and exchanged the older for the younger. Jacob was getting what he deserved. The seven extra years that Jacob had to serve Laban appear as a repayment for his treatment of Esau.

#### v.27-28
>Finish this daughter's bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work." <sup>28</sup>And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.

Jacob's past had caught up with him, and he could do no more than accept the results and serve Laban seven more years. At first it had looked as if Jacob's journey was in fact following the course that Rebekah had anticipated (27:44). Thus we are not surprised to read that Jacob's first seven years of working for Laban seemed as if they "only a few days." But with the discovery of Laban's trick, seven more years are added to Rebekah's "few days"; and Jacob's—and Rebekah's—plans begin to unravel

#### v.31
>When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.

In the preceding chapter God had promised that Jacob's descendants would be more numerous than the "dust of the earth." Now Rachel, Jacob's intended wife, was barren; and it appeared to be the Lord's doing. Again Jacob's plans have come to naught. He had planned to take Rachel as his wife, but God intended him to have Leah. Jacob sought to build a family through Rachel, but she was barren; and God opened Leah's womb.
**Jacob's schemes, which had brought him fortunes thus far, were beginning to crumble. Schemes will not sufficient to carry out the plans of God.** Jacob too will have to depend on God to bring about the divine blessing.
