See in [[Job1]].

#### v.31
>These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned:

This presupposes a knowledge of the kingship in Israel, or at least an anticipation of the kingship. Thus it is a part of those texts (e.g., [17:6](Genesis17#v.6), [16](Genesis17#v.16); [35:11](Genesis35#v.11-12)) that look forward to the promises of [Ge 49:10](Genesis49#v.10); [Nu 24:7](Numbers24#v.7); [17-18](Numbers24#v.17-18); and [Dt 17:14-20](Deut17) (cf. [1Sa 2:10](1Samuel2#v.10)).
