# Genesis 41

## Overview:



#### v.1
>When two full years had passed, Pharoah had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,


#### v.16
>"I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharoah, "but God will give Pharoah the answer he desires."



#### v.38
>So Pharoah asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?"

This is the first mention in the Bible of the Holy Spirit coming upon a man. It is interesting to note that it was in regard to more _practical_ things. Joseph didn’t have to preach a sermon or lead a prayer for Pharaoh to see the **Spirit of God** upon him. **He could see it in his character, in his message, in his knowledge, in his wisdom, and in his humility.**

#### v.40
>You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."

Joseph only _seemed_ to be an overnight success. In truth, his journey from the pit to the pinnacle took 13 hard years. This part of Joseph’s story reminds us of some important principles regarding promotion and advancement.

· _Promotion and advancement is from the Lord_ ([Psalm 75:6-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Psalm+75.6-7&t=NKJV)). This is not to say that hard work, preparation, good habits, and other human aspects do not contribute to success – they clearly do. Yet even those things are gifts and abilities from God and should be regarded with humility and gratitude toward Him.

· _Promotion and advancement is never enough without the Lord_. You can’t be so promoted or advance to where you stop needing Jesus. Often, promotion and success make us see our need for Jesus more than ever.

· _Jesus received the ultimate promotion or advancement_. Joseph’s path from humble servant and prisoner to powerful ruler becomes a prophecy of Jesus Himself. [Philippians 2:5-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Philippians+2.5-11&t=NKJV) describes that ultimate promotion.
