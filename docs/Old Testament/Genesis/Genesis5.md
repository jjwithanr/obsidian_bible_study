# Genesis 5

## Overview:


#### v.2
>He created them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created, he called them "man."

#### v.3
>When Adam had lived for 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.

The only peculiarity in the life of Adam is the statement that his son was "in his likeness, after his image." This is no doubt intended to include that depravity which had become the characteristic of fallen man. It is contrasted with the preceding notice that Adam was originally created in the image of God. If it had been intended merely to indicate that the offspring was of the same species with the parent, the phrase, "after his kind" (למינהוּ lemı̂ynâh, would have been employed, as in the first chapter. This is one of the mysteries of the race, when the head of it is a moral being, and has fallen. His moral depravity, affecting the essential difference of his nature, **descends to his offspring.**

#### v.22
>And after he became the father of Methusaleh, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.

Enoch walked with God after Methuselah had been born, three hundred years, and doubtless he had walked with him before. What a splendid walk! A walk of three hundred years! One might desire a change of company if he walked with anybody else, but to walk with God for three centuries was so sweet that the patriarch kept on with his walk until he walked beyond time and space, and walked into paradise.

#### v.24
>Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.

#### v.29
>He named him Noah and said, "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands cauesd by the ground the Lord has cursed."

He must have received a indication from God that Noah would play a special role in God’s plan for redemption. But then Lamech went too far and **assumed Noah was to be the promised seed**, the Messiah. So Lamech names Noah and claims he will put an end to the curse and bring our work to an end. Clearly, he was wrong. But by his statement, Lamech does create through his son a **picture of the coming Messiah.**
