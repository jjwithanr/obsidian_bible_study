# Genesis 19

## Overview:


#### v.14
>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.

The life of Lot shows us that it is possible to have a saved soul and a wasted life. Lot would be rescued, but his life would accomplish nothing, as in [1 Corinthians 3:15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Corinthians+3.15&t=NKJV): _If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire._

#### v.22
>But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar.)

Thus Lot's rescue is a result of prayer—Abraham's and his own. God had promised not to destroy the city "on behalf of" the righteous in it. So now, though Sodom was destroyed, Zoar was saved from the destruction on account of Lot, the righteous one living in it.
