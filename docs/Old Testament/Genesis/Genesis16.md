# Genesis 16

## Overview:



#### v.2
>so she said to Abram, "The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her."

**Those who are truly zealous for God frequently reach for fruit without first dying.** Unfortunately much Christian work is done in this way, and while there is conception, the child that is born can never be the heir. **Christian work that is done merely through the zeal of human effort without counting the body as dead**, and Sarai as good as dead, may produce great revival campaigns with but a **few genuinely saved**, large church memberships with many tares among the wheat

#### v.13
>She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."

After meeting with _El Roi_ (**You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees**), Hagar knew that if God could be with her in the wilderness, He would be with her in having to submit to Sarai also. It’s as if Hagar said to God, “You have looked upon me, and now I can look upon You.” That face-to-face relationship with God transforms.

#### v.15
>So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.

If we seek to change our circumstances, we will jump from the frying pan into the fire. We must be triumphant exactly where we are. It is not a change of climate we need, but a change of heart. The flesh wants to run away, but God wants to demonstrate His power exactly where we have known our greatest chagrin
