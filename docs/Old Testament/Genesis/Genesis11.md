# Genesis 11

## Overview:



#### v.4
>Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a **name for ourselves** and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth."

Instead of seeking the name of the Lord and the city of God, men made their own city to obtain their own testimony. And instead of seeking to reach God through a faith in His word, they seek to reach heaven by the work of their hands. [Revelation 3:12](Revelation3#v.12)

#### v.5
>But the **Lord came down** to see the city and the tower that the men were building.

Just as how Jesus came down to die for us while we were still sinners in [Romans 5:8](Romans5#v.8).

He still deals in mercy with a remnant of the human race, and has visited the earth and manifested His presence in a wondrous way. But He has not yet taken up His abode among people as He did in the garden, and as He intimates that He will sometime do on the renovated earth.

#### v.6
>The Lord said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.



#### v.7
>Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."

Out of his grace and mercy, God came down onto earth to intervene on the resurgence of man's sinful nature in priding themselves in their own accomplishments before heaven. He shows mercy by not letting them [be turned over to their sinful desires](Romans1#v.24). See also [[grace#Barnes on Revelation 2 24 Revelation2 v 24]].
