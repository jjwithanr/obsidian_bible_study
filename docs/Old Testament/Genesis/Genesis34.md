# Genesis 34

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Now, Dinah the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.

 Jacob chose a place to live for all the wrong reasons. He wanted to be close to the city ([Genesis 33:18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+33.18&t=NKJV)), though the city had a strong and ungodly influence. God called him to Bethel, and Jacob’s poor choice of a place to live left his family open to ungodly influence.

#### v.25
>Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.

The boldness with which they executed their foul plan shows the hardness of their hearts.

#### v.30
>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed."

Jacob! You brought that trouble on yourself. You passed your own deceitful nature into your boys. You set them a constant example of guile. They heard you lie to Esau at Peniel and start northwest after he went southeast. They saw your interest in the fat pastures when you pitched your tent in Shechem. You said nothing when Dinah was violated… Talk to God about your own sin before talking to these boys about theirs.
