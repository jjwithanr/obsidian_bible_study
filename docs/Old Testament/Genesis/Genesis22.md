# Genesis 22

## Overview:



#### v.9
>When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.

The younger man, perhaps five-and-twenty — so Josephus thinks — possibly thirty-three years of age, and, if so, very manifestly the type of Christ, who was about that age when he came to die

#### v.11
>But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!"
>"Here I am," he replied.

Often there are believers who wonder how they may know the will of God. **We believe that ninety per cent of the knowing of the will of God consists in willingness to do it before it is known**

#### v.18
>and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."

 In all this we discern certain primary and essential characteristics of the man who is saved through acceptance of the mercy of God proclaimed to him in a primeval gospel. Faith in God [Genesis 15](Genesis15#v.6), repentance toward him [Genesis 16](Genesis16), and fellowship with him [Genesis 18](Genesis18), are the three great turning-points of the soul's returning life. They are built upon the effectual call of God [Genesis 12](Genesis12), and culminate in unreserved resignation to him [Genesis 22](Genesis22). With wonderful facility has the sacred record descended in this pattern of spiritual biography from the rational and accountable race to the individual and immortal soul, and traced the footsteps of its path to God.
