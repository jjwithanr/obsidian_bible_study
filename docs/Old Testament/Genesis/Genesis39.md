# Genesis 39

In the world of plants, it takes many years for an acorn to become an oak; a squash might grow almost overnight.

When I thought that God was hard, I found it easy to sin; but when I found God so kind, so good, so overflowing with compassion, I smote upon my breast to think that I could ever have rebelled against one who loved me so, and sought my good
