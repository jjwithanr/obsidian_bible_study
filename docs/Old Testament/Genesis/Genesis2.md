## Overview:

How do we verifiy the truthfulness of what the writer states?
- Is there a credible naturalist or materialist account of the same events?
	- Science now leads us to understand the universe had a beginning.
	- Science points us to the complexity of life, refuting the idea of evolution.
	- Human distinction from all other forms is only explained by its special creation.
	- Scientific discovery points to the origin of creation being an intelligent God.
	- Human experience is witness to the truth fo humanity's fall recorded in Genesis.
- If Genesis isn't correct, a similar story must be, and no one has yet to produce it.

#### v.3
>And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.

#### v.4
>These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that **Yahweh God** made earth and heaven.

When the author has finished his acount of the seven days of creation (2:3), he then goes back to the word with which he began about God creating the heavens and earth and he repeats them (2:4). The author purposely expands the name of God. The reason he does it is because his focus in the next segment of what he's writing is going to be the beginning of God's covenant with Israel. That's why God has to be identified as YHWH.

#### v.5-6
>and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, <sup>6</sup>but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground—

Verses 5 and 6 give us the background: no bush or plants had yet sprung up. The verbs are in a "background" tense—similar to verses 1 and 2 in chapter 1.

#### v.7
>the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the groundand breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

Verbs are in a "historical narrative" tense.

#### v.8
>Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.

Humanity's creation did not take place in Eden, but in the barren land outside it.
