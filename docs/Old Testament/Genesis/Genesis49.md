# Genesis 49

## Overview:



#### v.3
>"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.

So a man may have great opportunities, and yet lose them. Uncontrolled passions may make him very little who otherwise might have been great.

#### v.4
>Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it.

My brothers and sisters, how much moral weight you lose in the church and in the world by your perpetual instability! No one ever attaches any importance to your opinion because your opinion has no importance in it—seeing that you yourself will contradict it in a very short time!

You shall have enough of God’s comfort to keep you alive, but not enough to give you joy in your spirit and consolation in your heart! Oh, I beseech you, ponder a little. Study the Word more—know what is right and defend what is right! Study the law more—know what is right and do what is right! Study God’s will more— know what He would have you do and then do it, for an unstable Christian never can excel!

#### v.10
>The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs and the obedience of the nations is his.

#### v.25
>because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breast and womb.

Then observe that the strength of God’s Joseph is divine strength. His arms were made strong by God. Why does one of God’s ministers preach the Gospel powerfully? Because God gives him assistance. Why does Joseph stand against temptation? Because God gives him aid. The strength of a Christian is divine strength.
