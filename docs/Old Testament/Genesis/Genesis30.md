#### v.
>

#### v.43
>In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.

The ancient Hebrew says, “The man burst out exceedingly exceedingly.” God blessed Jacob, but it was not because Jacob was especially good. It was because of the promises God made to Jacob ([Genesis 28:13-15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+28.13-15&t=NKJV)) and the covenant made to Abraham.

i. In the same way, blessing comes from the LORD to us not because we are great or good, but because of the covenant God has made with us through Jesus, and promises He has given us in His word.

ii. We may note Jacob’s principles for prosperity:

· Don’t make wealth your goal ([Genesis 30:25-26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+30.25-26&t=NKJV)).

· Don’t be afraid to work for others and try to increase their wealth before or as you work to increase your own wealth ([Genesis 30:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+30.27&t=NKJV)).

· Work hard, dedicating yourself to your employer’s success ([Genesis 30:26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+30.26&t=NKJV), [31:38-42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+31.38-42&t=NKJV)).

· Trust God ([Genesis 30:31-33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Genesis+30.31-33&t=NKJV)).
