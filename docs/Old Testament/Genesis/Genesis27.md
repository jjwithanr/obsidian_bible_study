# Genesis 27

## Overview:


#### v.13
>His mother said to him, "My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me."

Rebekah responds to Jacobâ€™s fears of bringing a a curse on himself by appropriating to herself any curse that may result. Can she do that? As this chapter demonstrates, a blessing is not transferable, and neither is the pronouncement of a curse. But in this case Rebekah is most likely referring to the consequences of the curse rather than the curse itself. Since deity is the enforcer of the curse, this acknowledgment that she has forced Jacob to deceive his father would target her if a curse was to result.

#### v.27-29
>So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed. <sup>28</sup>May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness-- an abundance of grain and new wine. <sup>29</sup>May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed."

The promise to Abraham (12:2-3) is alluded to the final words of the blessing. Similarly, Isaac's blessing foreshadows Jacob's later prophecy concerning the kingship of the house of Judah (cf. 49:8). Thus the words of Isaac are a crucial link in the development of the theme of the blessing of the seed of Abraham. So too Jacob's daring scheme is a link in the chain connecting the blessing of the offspring of Abraham with the rise of kingship in the house of Judah.
