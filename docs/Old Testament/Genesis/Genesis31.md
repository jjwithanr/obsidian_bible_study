# Genesis 31

## Overview:



#### v.13
>I am the God of Bethel, where you annointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.

You remember, some of you, perhaps, the first time when pardoning love was revealed to you — when you were brought to see the love of God in the great atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Well, to-night, the Lord says to you, ‘I am the same God as you have ever found me. I have not changed. I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed, even as your father Jacob was not consumed; for I was even to him the selfsame God.

#### v.14
>Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?"

Since you are saved and joined to Christ, appraise the world and ask, ‘Is there yet any portion for me?’ If you think there is, you are mistaken
