# Genesis 31

## Overview:


#### v.2
>And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been.

#### v.3
>Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."

#### v.5
>He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.

#### v.6-7
>You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength, <sup>7</sup>yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.

#### v.11
>The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.'

#### v.13
>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.

You remember, some of you, perhaps, the first time when pardoning love was revealed to you—when you were brought to see the love of God in the great atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Well, to-night, the Lord says to you, ‘I am the same God as you have ever found me. I have not changed. I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed, even as your father Jacob was not consumed; for I was even to him the selfsame God.

#### v.14
>Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?"

Since you are saved and joined to Christ, appraise the world and ask, ‘Is there yet any portion for me?’ If you think there is, you are mistaken

#### v.24
>Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."

#### v.26
>Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried of my daughters like captives in war."

#### v.35
>Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.

Rachel’s excuse that she had her period would have been sufficient to warn off Laban, for in the ancient world a woman in menstruation was considered a danger because menstrual blood was widely believed to be a habitat for demons.

#### v.42
>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."

“The Fear of Isaac” appears only in Genesis and may represent a cognomen (nickname) for the patron God as well as an implied threat against any violence by Laban (see 31:29). The reference to divine patrons, “Ashur, the god of your fathers,” is also found in Old \*Assyrian texts (early second millennium B.C.).

#### v.53
>May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
