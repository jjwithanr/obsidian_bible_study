# 2 Chronicles 24

## Overview:


#### v.5
>He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now." But the Levites did not act at once.

#### v.15
>Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.

Jehoiada lived longer than Moses (120 years) and Aaron (123 years), **showing his great favor with God.** The fact that the Chronicler called attention to Jehoiadaâ€™s age shows his great importance, equal to any of the Judahite monarchs. Egyptian texts considered 110 to be the ideal old age, while Mesopotamian ideas targeted 120. In the sixth century, Adad-Guppi, the mother of the Babylonian king Nabonidus, is said to have lived to the age of 104.

#### v.21
>But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's temple.

Zechariah was murdered in the same place where his father Jehoiada had anointed Joash king ([2 Chronicles 23:10-11](2Chron23#v.10-11)).

#### v.22
>King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, "May the LORD see this and call you to account."

Zechariah's dying prayer, "May the Lord see this and call you to account," is one of imprecation rather than of forgiveness; but it is justified because of Zechariah's position as the Lord's prophet and because of the king's wickedness in going against the Lord.
