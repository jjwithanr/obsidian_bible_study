# 2 Chronicles 16

## Overview:


#### v.7
>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.

#### v.8
>Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horseman? Yet when you relied on the Lord, he delivered them into your hand.

#### v.9
>For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."

As people's eyes range through the earth to find something that can strongly support them, God longs for eye contact. His eyes look all around because he longs for his people to look only to Him in times of calamity. Just look at Him.

#### v.10
>Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.

#### v.12-13
>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians. <sup>13</sup>Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his fathers.

The fact that Asa chose to consult only physicians, who were at times associated with magical rituals or, at best, herbal remedies, further demonstrates his failure to seek God’s aid and thereby contributed to his own death.

#### v.14
>They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.

The funeral rites for Asa are quite elaborate and include the burning of spices in his honor as well as a general lamentation and internment in his family tomb. The fire does not imply cremation of the body or an attempt to mask the odors associated with a diseased body, but was rather an expensive display of the king’s wealth

King Asa died rich to Judah but poor to God.
