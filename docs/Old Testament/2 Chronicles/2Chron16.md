# 2 Chronicles 16

## Overview:



#### v.9
>For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."

As people's eyes range through the earth to find something that can strongly support them, God longs for eye contact. His eyes look all around because he longs for his people to look only to Him in times of calamity. Just look at Him.
