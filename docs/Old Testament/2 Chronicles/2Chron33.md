# 2 Chronicles 33

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.

**Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king**: This means that he was born in the **_last fifteen years_** of Hezekiah’s life, the **_additional_** fifteen years that Hezekiah prayed for (2 Kings 20:6). Those additional fifteen years brought Judah one of its worst kings.
