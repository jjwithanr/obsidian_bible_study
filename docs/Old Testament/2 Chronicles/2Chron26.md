# 2 Chronicles 26

## Overview:


#### v.5
>He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.

#### v.16
>But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.

In the chapter's latter section, on Uzziah's religious deviation, his sin in entering the temple to burn incense consisted not simply in usurping what was an exclusively priestly prerogative (v.18; Ex 30:7-8; cf. Nu 18:7), but perhaps also in arrogating to himself a Canaanite type of office, of semi-divine priest-king (see Ge 14:18; cf. Nu 12:10).

#### v.18
>They confronted him and said, "It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God."

#### v.20
>When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him.
