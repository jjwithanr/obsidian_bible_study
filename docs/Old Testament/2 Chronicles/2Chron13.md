# 2 Chronicles 13

## Overview:


#### v.5
>Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?

The Lord has indeed "given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendents" and this was to be "forever" (1Ch 17:14), which seems to be the meaning of the phrase "a covenant of salt." Salt is well known as a preservative, hence the idea of "everlastingness."
