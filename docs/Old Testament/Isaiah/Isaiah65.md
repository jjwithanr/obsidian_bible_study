# Isaiah 65

## Overview:



#### v.1-2
>"I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me; I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seem Me. I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' To a nation which did not call on My name. <sup>2</sup>I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people, Who walk in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts,

We therefore understand that v.1 applies to the Gentiles and v.2 to the Jews.

#### v.8
>This is what the Lord says: "As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say, 'Don't destroy it, there is yet some good in it,' "

Here again is the important doctrine of the remnant. The vineyard of Israel, so unproductive (5:1-4), has nevertheless produced some genuine grapes. They are the servants of God. In them the promises to "the chosen people" find their fulfillment, for this remnant is "my people who seek me." Those who had a responsibility to seek the Lord on the basis of it, while those who had never known its light would receive it through a new divine initiative (v.1).

#### v.24
>Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.

The greatest blessing they will know, however, will be a relationship with God in which there is complete harmony between their prayer and his will, between his desire and to provide and their dependence on him to give.
