#### v.2
>In that day— "Sing about a fruitful vineyard:

#### v.3
>I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.

#### v.4
>I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire.

#### v.5
>Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me."

#### v.6
>In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.

#### v.7
>Has \[the LORD\] struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?

>By warfare and exile you contend with her— with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows.

#### v.9
>By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing.

#### v.10
>The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.
