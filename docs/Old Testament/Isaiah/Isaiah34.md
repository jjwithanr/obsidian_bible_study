# Isaiah 34

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it!

#### v.2
>The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is upon all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter.

#### v.3
>Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will send up a stench; the mountains will be soaked with their blood.

#### v.4
>All the stars of the heavens will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree.

The ultimate character of this judgement encompasses the entire cosmos (cf. [24:21-23](Isaiah24#v.21-23); [Mt 24:29](Matthew24#v.29); [2Pe 3:10](2Peter3#v.10); and esp. [Rev 6:13-14](Revelation6#v.13-14)). The way Isaiah illustrates this truth of cosmic judgement from situations familiar to his readers heightens the impression of God's absolute control over all things (cf. [40:12](Isaiah40#v.12)).

#### v.5
>My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed.

#### v.6
>The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood, it is covered with fatâ€” the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in Edom.

#### v.7
>And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat.

#### v.8
>For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion's cause.

#### v.9
>Edom's streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch!

#### v.10
>It will not be quenched night and day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.

#### v.11
>The desert owl and screech owl will possess it; the great owl and the raven will nest there. God will stretch out over Edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.

#### v.12
>Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away.

#### v.13
>Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.

#### v.14
>Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; there the night creatures will also repose and find for themselves places of rest.

#### v.15
>The owl will nest there and lay eggs, she will hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there also the falcons will gather, each with its mate.

#### v.16
>Look in the scroll of the LORD and read: None of these will be missing, not one will lack her mate. For it is his mouth that has given the order, and his Spirit will gather them together.

#### v.17
>He allots their portions; his hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation.
