# Isaiah 41

## Overview:


#### v.5-7
>The islands have seen it and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward; <sup>6</sup>each helps the other and says to his brother, "Be strong!" <sup>7</sup>The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil. He says of the welding, "It is good." He nails down the idol so it will not topple.

#### v.10
>So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

God settles our fears with seemingly the same truth: He is with us. See also [Hebrews 13:5](Hebrews13#v.5).

#### v.13
>For I am the Lord, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.

#### v.20
>so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the Lord has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.

The purpose of wilderness.

#### v.21
>"Present your case," says the Lord. "Set forth your arguments," says Jacob's King.

There needs no more to show the folly of sin, than to bring to notice the reasons given in defence of it. There is nothing in idols worthy of regard. They are less than nothing, and worse than nothing. Let the advocates of other doctrines than that of salvation through Christ, bring their arguments. Can they tell of a cure for human depravity?

#### v.24
>But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; he who chooses you is detestable.

#### v.29
>See, they are all false! Their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion.

Isaiah describes the idols themselves as a wind since they are formless and lack solidity. Jesus describes faith as wind, so what gives? Our faith is not based anything tangible in our senses. It is like the wind but its object we believe is sure to be solid and powerful.
