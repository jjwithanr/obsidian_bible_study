# Isaiah 52

## Overview:



#### v.7
>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, "Your God reigns!"

Seen on the distant hills, running rapidly, he is a beautiful object. It is his feet, his running, his haste, that attracts attention; an indication that he bears a message of joy, and that the nation is about to be restored.

#### v.12
>But you will not leave in haste or go in flight; for the Lord will go before you, the God of Israel will be your rear guard.

This is partly an analogy and partly a contrast with the story of the first Exodus. The unusual word translated ‘with haste’ is employed in the Pentateuch to describe the hurry and bustle, not altogether due to the urgency of the Egyptians, but partly also to the terror of Israel, with which that first flight was conducted. And, says my text, in **this new coming out of bondage there shall be no need for tremor or perturbation**, lending wings to any man’s feet; but, with quiet deliberation, like that with which Peter was brought out of his dungeon, because God knew that He could bring him out safely, the new Exodus shall be carried on.

There is no need for a Christian man ever to be flurried, or to lose his self-command, or ever to be in an undignified and unheroic hurry. His march should be unceasing, swift, but calm and equable, as the motions of the planets, unhasting and unresting.

Lord, make this promise my confidence as I graduate from UCI. You will go before me. Why do I leave in haste when Your goodness and mercy follows after me?

#### v.15
>so he will sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.

If the word used here means 'to sprinkle,' it is used in one of the following significations:

1. To sprinkle with blood, in allusion to the Levitical rite of sprinkling the blood of the sacrifice, meaning that in that way sin would be expiated and removed [Leviticus 14:51](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-51.htm); [Leviticus 16:14](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-14.htm); [Hebrews 9:19](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-19.htm); [Hebrews 10:22](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm); or,

1. By an allusion to the custom of sprinkling with water as emblematic of purity, or cleansing [Numbers 8:7](https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm); [Numbers 19:18](https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-18.htm); [Ezekiel 36:25](https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm). If used in the former sense, it means, that the Redeemer would make expiation for sin, and that his blood of purifying would be sprinkled on the nations.
