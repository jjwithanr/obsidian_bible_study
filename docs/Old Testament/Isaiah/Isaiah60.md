# Isaiah 60

## Overview:



#### v.1-2
>"Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you. <sup>2</sup>See, darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you."

As far as we have the knowledge of God in us, and the favour of God towards us, our light is come.

The Hebrew word (יראה yērâ'eh) does not mean merely that that glory would be visible, but that it would be conspicuous. It would be so bright and luminous that it would be seen afar - like a cloud or column of glory standing over Jerusalem that would be conspicuous to far distant people.

#### v.14
>The sons of your oppressors will come bowing before you; all who despise you will bow down at your feet and will call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

What a God that He makes His enemies His friends.
#jj 

#### v.18
>No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.

#### v.19
>The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.

The idea is, the light and beauty of truth would be so great; the divine perfections shine forth so illustriously under the gospel, that the eye would be attracted to that light as superior to all the natural splendor of the sun and moon. All the wonders and beauties of the natural world would be lost in the superior brightness that would shine in the moral world.

We see everything in the natural in part as the sun rises in the day and sets by night. But one day we shall see everything as it is when the perfect comes.
#jj 

#### v.20
>Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.
