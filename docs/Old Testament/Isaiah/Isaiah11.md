# Isaiah 11

## Overview:



#### v.3
>and he will delight in the fear of the Lord. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears;

There is much to fear in the world without the Lord. How delightful it is, then, to have our one fear in life be of Him who is also able to see down to ours hearts and judges with perfect righteousness!
#jj 


#### v.4
>but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.

A wise man once said, "His mouth is Jesus' choicest weapon."
#jj 

#### v.9
>They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.

Katlyn quoted commentators who also compared the seas having varying depths. Some parts of the seas will experience a greater depth of God's knowledge since they prepared the way.
