# Isaiah 62

## Overview:



#### v4
>No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Belulah; for the Lord will take delight in you, and your land will be married.


#### v.6-7
>I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, <sup>7</sup>and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.

God's professing people must be a praying people. He is not displeased with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids us to cry after him, and give him no rest, Lu 11:5,6. It is a sign that God is coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon them.

God is always the same-equally near, equally strong, equally gracious. But our possession of His grace, and the impartation of His grace through us to others, vary, because our faith, our earnestness, our desires, vary.

We may have as much of God as we want, as much as we can hold, far more than we deserve.

#### v.12
>They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the Lord; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.
