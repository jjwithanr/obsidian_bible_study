# Isaiah 9

## Overview:

#### v.6
>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

#### v.7
>Of the incense of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.

#### v.17
>Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks vileness. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.

The prophets makes it clear that although the nation was being led astray by its leaders and its false prophets, and the guilt of these was therefore great, nobody was without blame. Even the fatherless and widows, the socially disadvantaged, must share in the judgement; for the contagion of godlessness had spread throughout the whole nation. The order "ungodly" and "wicked" suggests that the first was the cause of the second (cf. Ro 1:18).
