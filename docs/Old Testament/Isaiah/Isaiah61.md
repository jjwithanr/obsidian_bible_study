# Isaiah 61

## Overview:



#### v.1
>The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners,

Am I poor? Am I brokenhearted over my sin? If not, do not mind the gospel for you will one day see where your "salvation" brings upon you. It is the poor in spirit and the brokenhearted Jesus came to save.

#### v.10
>I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoice in my God. For he has clothed me with  garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

#### v.11
>For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
