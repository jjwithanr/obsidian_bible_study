# Isaiah 53

## Overview:


#### v.3
>He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

#### v.4-5
>Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. <sup>5</sup>But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.

#### v.6
>We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

#### v.10

#### v.11
>After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light \[of life\] and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.
