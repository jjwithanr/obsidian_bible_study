# Isaiah 17

## Overview:



#### v.7
>In that day men will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.

#### v.8
>They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles and the incense altars their fingers have made.


#### v.10-11
>You have forgotten God your Savior; you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress. Therefore, though you set out the finest plants and plant imported vines, <sup>11</sup>though on the day you set them out, you make them grow, and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud, yet the harvest will be as nothing in the day of disease and incurable pain.

The original application of these words is to Judahâ€™s alliance with Damascus, which Isaiah was dead against. He saw that it would only precipitate the Assyrian invasion, as in fact it did. Judah had forsaken God, and because they had done so, they had gone to seek for themselves delights-alliance with Damascus.
Notice the Sin charged. It is merely negative-**forgettest**. There is no charge of positive hostility or of any overt act. This forgetfulness is most natural and easy to be fallen into. The constant pressure of the world. It indicates alienation of heart from God.

#### v.13
>Although the people roar like the roar of surging waters, when he rebukes them they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweed before a gale.

At the racing thoughts of our minds, we can remember our God is a God who drives it away at the sound of his rebuke for they have no weight on the regenerated soul.
