# Isaiah 31

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel, or seek help from the Lord.

The fault found in they who relied on horses and chariots is they had not looked to the Holy One. Beloved, fix your eyes on Him
#jj 

#### v.3
>But the Egyptians are men and not God; their horses are flesh and not spirit. When the Lord stretches out his hand, he who helps will stumble, he who is helped will fall; both will perish together.

Things on earth that seem to possess God's powers will always be bound to their flesh.
#jj
