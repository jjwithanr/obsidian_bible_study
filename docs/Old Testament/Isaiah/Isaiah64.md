# Isaiah 64

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you!

#### v.4
>Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.

#### v.5
>You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved?

Sin is a continual practice; it is defiling, it is destructive, and it creates a barrier between God and humankind - both from our side, for we do not want to pray, and from God's because he will not hear us. God himself has determined that it will have these results. No wonder the people cry out, "How then can we be saved?"

#### v.7
>No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins.

#### v.8
>Yet, O Lord, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.
