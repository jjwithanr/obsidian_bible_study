# Isaiah 6

## Overview:



#### v.1
>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on the throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.


#### v.2
>Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.

This is the only place in Scripture where a supernatural creature is designated as a seraph. The serpents that plagued the Israelites in the wilderness, however, also go by that designation, and Isaiah twice refers to flying serpents (NIV: “darting” 14:29; 30:6). Since supernatural creatures are often portrayed as composite (see comment on Gen 3:24), there is therefore good reason to think of the seraphs as winged serpents. Since the Hebrew root sarap is usually associated with “burning,” there is also good reason to associate these creatures with fire. Ancient Near Eastern literature offers some support for these portrayals. Fiery serpents are well known in Egyptian art and literature. There the serpent, or uraeus, is a symbol of royalty and authority.

>"Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty."

>Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
