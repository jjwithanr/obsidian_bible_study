# Isaiah 42

## Overview:



#### v.2-3
>He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. <sup>3</sup>A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;

#### v.4
>he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands put their hope."

#### v.17
>But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame.

The sense here is, that they should find no such protection in their idol-gods as they had hoped, and that they should be covered with conscious guilt forever, having trusted in them and given to them the homage which was due to the true God.

While the people of God are led by God's hand through new paths, and are illumined with abundant light, and have their difficulties smoothed away from before them. their idolatrous oppressors will be "turned back" or suffer defeat, and be put to shame, finding no help from their idols, whose powerlessness will be openly shown, to the utter confusion of their votaries.

#### v.19
>Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD?

#### v.20
>You have seen many things, but have paid no attention; your ears are open, but you hear nothing."

#### v.21
>It pleased the Lord for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious.

Multitudes are ruined for want of observing that which they cannot but see; they perish, **not through ignorance, but carelessness.** The Lord is well-pleased in the making known his own righteousness. For their sins they were spoiled of all their possessions. This fully came to pass in the destruction of the Jewish nation.

#### v.23
>Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come?

#### v.25
>So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.

They refused to attend to it, and lay it to heart. They pursued their ways of wickedness, regardless of the threatening judgments, and the impending wrath of God.

The prophet's view is that Israel, as a whole, was not greatly bettered by the Captivity, at any rate up to the time which he takes for his standpoint, and at which he supposes him.
