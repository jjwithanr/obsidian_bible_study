# Isaiah 48

## Overview:



#### v.9
>For my own name's sake I delay my wrath; for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you, so as not to cut you off.

It was on his own account - in order to show his covenant faithfulness; his fidelity to the promises made to their fathers, his mercy, his compassion, his readiness to pardon, and his unchanging love.

#### v.10
>See, I have refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.

Similar to [Psalm 119:71](Psalm119.md#v.71).

#### v.11
>For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another.

#### v.16
>"Come near me and listen to this: "From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there." And now the Sovereign Lord has sent me, with his Spirit.

The Holy Spirit qualifies for service; and those may speak boldly, whom God and his Spirit send.
Whom God redeems, he teaches; he teaches to profit by affliction, and then makes them partakers of his holiness.

#### v.18
>If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

Loss of attention to God's commands makes us prone to restlessness and wickedness.
#jj 

#### v.22
>"There is no peace," says the Lord, "for the wicked."

Lord, make me a soul winner.
