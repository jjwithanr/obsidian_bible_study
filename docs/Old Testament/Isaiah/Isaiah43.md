# Isaiah 43

## Overview:



#### v.19
>See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.

#### v.25
>I, even I, am he who blots out your transgression, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.

Nor is it primarily in order that we may be happy, for our happiness is a matter not worthy to be named, compared with the honor of God. But it is solely for his own sake - to promote his glory - to show his perfections - to evince the greatness of his mercy and compassion - and to show his boundless and eternal love.
