# Isaiah 43

## Overview:

#### v.4-5
>Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life. <sup>5</sup>Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west.

#### v.19
>See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.

#### v.25
>I, even I, am he who blots out your transgression, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.

Nor is it primarily in order that we may be happy, for our happiness is a matter not worthy to be named, compared with the honor of God. But it is solely for his own sake - to promote his glory - to show his perfections - to evince the greatness of his mercy and compassion - and to show his boundless and eternal love.
