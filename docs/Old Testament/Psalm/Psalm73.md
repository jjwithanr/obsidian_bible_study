## Overview:


#### v.
>

#### v.16

#### v.17
>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.

[Spurgeon sermon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs486.pdf).

The difficulty was not to be solved by any mere human reasoning - by the powers of man, away from God; **it was to be learned in the presence of God himself**, and in the disclosures which He made about his divine plans and purposes. The psalmist had tried his own powers of reason, and the subject was above his reach. The only solution of the difficulty was to be obtained by a near approach to God himself. There the mystery could be solved, and there it was solved. The "end" of all this, as disclosed by God, would determine why, it was permitted, and would remove the perplexity of the mind.

Our heavenly Father stands watching for the moment when our redeemed spirit shall pass into His hands that He may receive it. Our Savior, who bought us with His precious blood, stands waiting to receive the jewel for which He paid so dear a price.

Oh, with God as our counsel, shall we come into full agreement with his work within us! Oh, my soul command my knowledge and insight to surrender at the feet of the Lord's counsel. For it is HIS counsel that shall take me into HIS glory, not mine.
