# Psalm73

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.

The "pure" (GK 2342) are not perfect but live in loyalty to God in speech and action, thus evidencing their "pure" motives. They are without hypocrisy.

#### v.2-3
>But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold. <sup>3</sup>For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

The psalmist readily and publicly admits that he "envied the arrogant" and ungodly in their "prosperity." Engaged in self-pity and questioning God's justice, he was filled with resentment and could easily have joined those he envied. He nearly failed, but God sustained him and kept him.

1/5/23 In this past season, I've become more aware of my pride through how often I self-pity in times of failure. It becomes harder to celebrate others' victories and rejoice in their rejoicing. Self-pity is sin because it only concerns the self. Lord, help me to heed this psalm and live out Philippians 2 where I consider others as better than myself.

#### v.13-14
>Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence. <sup>14</sup>All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning.

The psalmist confesses that he doubted the value of his own concern with sanctification. Keeping his heart "pure" and his hands "washed...in innocence" expresses his concern for justice and righteousness. The psalmist confesses his self-dobut and envy. **Being "plagued" and "punished" probably refers to his mental turmoil.**

VanGemeren's comment on verse 14 is so relatable. In this jobless season, I feel I've suffered so much mental turmoil in processing where God has me and where God is leading in this season.

#### v.16
>When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me

#### v.17
>till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.

[Spurgeon sermon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs486.pdf).

The difficulty was not to be solved by any mere human reasoning - by the powers of man, away from God; **it was to be learned in the presence of God himself**, and in the disclosures which He made about his divine plans and purposes. The psalmist had tried his own powers of reason, and the subject was above his reach. The only solution of the difficulty was to be obtained by a near approach to God himself. There the mystery could be solved, and there it was solved. The "end" of all this, as disclosed by God, would determine why, it was permitted, and would remove the perplexity of the mind.

#### v.21-22
>When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered, I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you. <sup>22</sup>I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.

The psalmist was deeply affected by envy and anguish. Deep inside he was grieved and embittered, resulting in a state of depression. In this state he was irrational (cf 94:8), not ruled by wisdom.

#### v.23
>Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.

See also [[Hebrews13#v.5]].

God had not abandoned Asaph because of Asaph's sin of envying the wicked. He was still with Asaph. Their relationship had not been severed. Asaph felt as if he'd almost fallen away from faith because of bitterness (Psalm 73:2), but God did not let him fall.
#bibleref 

Notwithstanding my low and unworthy views, notwithstanding my doubts about the justice of the divine administration, notwithstanding my envy at the prosperity of the wicked, and my spirit of complaining against God, I am not driven away from God; I am not banished from his presence, or cut off from his favor. Well may we marvel when we reflect on our thoughts about God, that He has not risen in his anger, and banished us from his presence forever and ever.

#### v.24
>You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into your glory.

Our heavenly Father stands watching for the moment when our redeemed spirit shall pass into His hands that He may receive it. Our Savior, who bought us with His precious blood, stands waiting to receive the jewel for which He paid so dear a price.
#spurgeon

Oh, with God as our counsel, shall we come into full agreement with his work within us! Oh, may my soul command my knowledge and insight to surrender at the feet of the Lord's counsel. For it is HIS counsel that shall take me into HIS glory, not mine.
#jj 

#### v.25
>Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing i desire besides you.

#### v.26
>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
