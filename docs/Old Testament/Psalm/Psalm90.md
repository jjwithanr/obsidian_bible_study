# Psalm 90

## Overview:


#### v.12
>Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

Counting our days points us to count inadequecy in light of death. 
#jj 

#### v.14
>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.

The only thing that will secure life-long gladness is a heart satisfied with the experience of Godâ€™s love.
