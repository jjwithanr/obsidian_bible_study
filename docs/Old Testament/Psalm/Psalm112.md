#### v.9
>He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor, his righteousness endures forever; his horn will be lifted high in honor.

The psalmist has singled out generosity and compassion as the hallmarks of wise living. Such living leads to lasting success. The work of the godly endures; their reward is in the exaltation and honor of their children.
