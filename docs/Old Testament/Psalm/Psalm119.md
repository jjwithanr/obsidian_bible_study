# Psalm119

## Overview:


#### v.9-11
>How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. <sup>10</sup>I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands. <sup>11</sup>I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.

#### v.18
>Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.

[[Luke8]]

#### v.27
>Let me understand the teaching of your precepts; then I will meditate on your wonders.

#### v.28
>My soul is weary with sorrow; strenghten me according to your word.

#### v.32
>I shall run the way of Your commandments, For You will **enlarge my heart.**

#nasb

Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart   
with boundless charity divine,   
so shall I all my strength exert,   
and love them with a zeal like thine,   
and lead them to thy open side,   
the sheep for whom the Shepherd died.

#### v.34
>Give me understanding, and I will keep your law and obey it with all my heart.

Give me right views of it, of its nature and obligation. It is not a prayer that God would give him the faculty of understanding or intelligence; but that he would enable him to take just views of the law. The word is the same as in [Psalm 119:27](Psalm119#v.27), rendered there, "Make me to understand."

The understanding operates upon the affections; it convinces the heart of the beauty of the law, so that the soul loves it with all its powers; and then it reveals the majesty of the lawgiver, and the whole nature bows before his supreme will.

#### v.50
>My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promises preserves my life.

#### v.71
>It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees.

Let nothing be wasted. Suffering is not God's lack of care but His abundance.
#jj 

#### v.162
>I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil.

God, I want to rejoice in your promises as much as I do when I find out I get a job, see that I ended with good grades, or any other material success. Why does it have to be different?
#jj 

#### v.165
>Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble.

See [[law#MacLaren on Psalm 119 165 Psalm119 v 165]].

See the notes at [Isaiah 26:3](Isaiah26.md#v.3); compare the notes at [Philippians 4:6-7](Philippians4#v.6-7). They have great calmness of mind. They are not troubled and anxious. They believe and feel that all things are well-ordered by thee, and will be conducted to the best result. They, therefore, calmly leave all with thee. As a matter of fact, the friends of God have peace and calmness in their minds, even amidst the troubles, the disappointments, and the reverses of life. The love of God is the best - the only - way to secure permanent peace in the soul.

The meaning here is, that they would not fall into sin; they would be kept safe; they would be preserved from the power of temptation. The meaning is not, as it would seem to be in our version, that nothing would pain, grieve, or irritate them; but, as above, that as long as they were obedient to the law, and disposed to obey it, they would be safe from the power of temptation.

#### v.173
>May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.

Lord, help me. I have chosen you, yet I stumble so often.
#jj 

#### v.176
>I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant for I have not forgotten your commands.

Lord, I have strayed in my inclinations of finding comfort in my procrastination through YouTube and social media. I desire to seek you, yet it is so hard to fight through the shame and discouragements in my mind. But Lord, seek me out for I have not forgotten your commands. I trust in your deliverance and your right hand shall sustain me.
