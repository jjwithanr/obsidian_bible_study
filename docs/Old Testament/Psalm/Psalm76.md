# Psalm 76

## Overview:


#### v.7
>You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?

#### v.10
>Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt.

All acts are under God's sovereign control. Even the most hostile acts against his rule will bring him "praise." The Lord turns a person's rebellious expression of anger to his glory.
