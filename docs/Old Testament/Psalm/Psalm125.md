# Psalm 125

## Overview:



#### v.2
>As the mountans surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people both now and forevermore.

As Jerusalem is thus protected by the hills around, so the people of God are protected by Yahweh. He surrounds the church; he is exalted far above the church;** he guards the approaches to the church;** he can defend it from all its foes. Under his protection it is safe. Jerusalem, as surrounded by hills and mountains, has thus become an emblem of the church at all times; its security was an emblem of the security of all who trust in the Lord.
