# Psalm 147

## Overview:



#### v.3
>He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.

#### v.6
>The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground.

#### v.10-11
>His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of a man; <sup>11</sup>the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.

They know the vanity of military, logistical, or human power, because the "strength of the horse" or "a man" is nothing in comparison with the Lord's "power"
 (v.5).
