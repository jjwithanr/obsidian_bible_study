# Psalm 109

## Overview:



#### v.4
>In return for my friendship they accuse me, but **I am a man of prayer**.

literally, *"I - prayer;"* that is, I am all prayer; I continually pray. This may mean, either, that he bore these trials with a meek spirit, and did not allow these things to disturb his devotions; or, more probably, that he prayed constantly "for them;" he desired their good, and sought it from above.
