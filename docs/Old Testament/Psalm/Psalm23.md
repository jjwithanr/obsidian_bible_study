# Psalm 23

## Overview:


#### v.1
>The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.

The emphasis of the psalmist is on "my." The temptation in ancient Israel is also the God of individuals. The metaphor of the shepherd is not only a designation or name of the Lord, but it points toward the relation between God and his covenant-children: "I shall not be in want."

#### v.3
>he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

"Righteousness" (GK 7406) here signifies "right" in the sense of "straight," i.e., the paths that bring the sheep most directly to their destination. He does not unnecessarily tire out his sheep. Even when the "right paths" bring the sheep "through the valley of the shadow of death," there is no need to fear.

#### v.4
>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,Â I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

The shepherd's care is symbolized by the "rod" and the "staff." A shepherd carried a rod to club wild animals and a staff to keep the sheep in control. These two represent God's contant vigilance over his own bring "comfort" because of his own personal presence and involvement with his sheep.

#### v.5
>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

Before the entering the banquet hall, an ancient host would anoint the honored guests with oil made by adding perfumes to olive oil. The overflowing "cup" symbolizes the care and provisions of God, previously represented by "green pastures" and "quiet waters." Moreover, the Lord vindicates his servant "in the presence of \[his enemies\]," expressing both the adversities of life and God's love toward his own. **In the presence of God, the guests forget their troubles and tears.**

#### v.6
>Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

In a season of hopelessness and deeply entrenched cynicism, Silvia reminded me of this verse of the character of God. His goodness and love follows me the days of my life even when my pride and unbelief blinds me from seeing it as it is.
