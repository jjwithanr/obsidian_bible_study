# Psalm 68

## Overview:


#### v.6
>God sets the lonely in families,Â he leads forth the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.

Wherever there are oppressed people, whether they belong to the people of God or not, the Lord's rule brings transformation from injustice to justice and from oppression to vindication. He changes their sorrow to "singing" by judging the rebellious.

#### v.19-20
>Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens. Selah <sup>20</sup>Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death.

The comfort of God's presence occassions a renewal of praise. He is "the Lord" (GK 151), who promised deliverance and victory (v.11) and now cares deeply for his people and leads them out of "death." He is "God our Savior" and his nature sets in motion the history of redemption, because "our God is a God who saves." His rules extends over all angels in heaven and to all the earth. He is known to the believing community as "Sovereign Lord."
