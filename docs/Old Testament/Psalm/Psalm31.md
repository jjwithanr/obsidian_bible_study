# Psalm31

## Overview:



#### v.14
>But I trust in you, O Lord; I say , "You are my God."

#### v.24
>Be strong and let your heart take courage, All you who wait for Yahweh.

The lesson is this: It is with the heart we must wait upon God. “Let your heart take courage.” All our waiting depends upon the state of the heart. As a man’s heart is, so is he before God.
