# Psalm27

## Overview:

#### v.
>

#### v.14
>Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.

The one lesson our text teaches us is thus, that when we set ourselves to wait on God we ought beforehand to **resolve that it shall be with the most confident expectation of Godâ€™s meeting and blessing us.** We ought to make up our minds to this, that nothing was ever so sure, as that waiting on God will bring us untold and unexpected blessing. We are so accustomed to judge of God and His work in us by what we feel, that the great probability is that when we begin more to cultivate the waiting on Him, we shall be discouraged, because we do not find any special blessing from it.

If you say that you are afraid of deceiving yourself with vain hope, because you do not see or feel any warrant in your present state for such special expectations, my answer is, **It is God, who is the warrant for your expecting great things.** Oh, do learn the lesson. You are not going to wait on yourself to see what you feel and what changes come to you. You are going to WAIT ON GOD, to know first, WHAT HE IS, and then, after that, what He will do. The whole duty and blessedness of waiting on God has its root in this, that He is such a blessed Being, full, to overflowing, of goodness and power and life and joy, that we, however wretched, cannot for any time come into contact with Him, without that life and power secretly, silently beginning to enter into us and blessing us.
