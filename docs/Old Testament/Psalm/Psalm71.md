#### v.1
>In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.

#### v.2
>Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me.

#### v.3
>Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.

#### v.4
>Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men.

#### v.5-6
>For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth. <sup>6</sup>From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you.

#### v.7
>I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.

Although he has become a "portent" (GK 4603; i.e., a sign of trouble and divine retribution) to his contemporaries, he nevertheless throws himself on God as his refuge. The Lord has been close to him in deliverance and protection throughout his life.
