# Psalm 115

## Overview:


#### v.2
>Why do the nations say, "Where is their God?"

#### v.5-7
>They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but they cannot see; <sup>6</sup>they have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but they cannot smell; <sup>7</sup>they have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but they cannot walk; nor can they utter a sound with their throats.

#### v.8
>Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.

This theme of idolatry causing the stupefaction of individuals is carried on throughout the Bible, even into the New Testament. What we often see in both Old and New Testaments is the condemnation of people whose eyes and ears do not work properly, just like the idols! The implication within the language is that idolatry confounds the senses and does not allow us to hear and obey God.

#### v.13
>he will bless those who fear the LORDâ€”small and great alike.
