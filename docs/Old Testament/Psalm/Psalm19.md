# Psalm 19

## Overview:


#### v.1
>The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.

#### v.2
>Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge.

#### v.7
>The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.

One of the reasons why it needs no special education to be a Christian is that **Christianity is an education in itself.** That is why an uneducated believer like Bunyan was able to write a book that has astonished the whole world.

I learned to love reading by reading the Bible with the aid of free online commentaries. I despised reading growing up, but the Word has opened my eyes to the wonder of His word. It has indeed revived my soul.

#### v.8
>The precepts of the LORD are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.

Thus the Lord has made the sun for light in creation and given his word for light in redemption.

#### v.9
>The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of the LORD are sure and altogether righteous.

#### v.10
>They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.

#### v.11
>By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.

Is this not true faith? Faith demands belief in His existence—implying the truthfulness of His word—and the expectation that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him. See [[Hebrews11#v 6]].

#### v.14
>May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.

The heavens "declare," "proclaim," "pour forth," and "display" without the benefit of human speech; yet they speak clearly of the glory, power, and wisdom of God. The Lord has revelead his word in speech and written forms accessible to people. In turn the psalmist, as a redeemed creature of God, prays that his expressed and unspoken words may be acceptable to his God, his Rock and his Redeemer; namely, the Lord, the covenant-loving God.
