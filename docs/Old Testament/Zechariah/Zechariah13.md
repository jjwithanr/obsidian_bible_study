# Zechariah 13

## Overview:


#### v.1
>"On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.

Verse 1 contains new-covenant terminology. In Jer 31:33-34 God promised Israel: (1) enablement through his Spirit to obey his law (v.33a; Eze 36:26-27); (2) an intimate personal relationship and fellowship (v.33b); (3) a saving knowledge of himself (v.34a; Ro 11:26a); and (4) forgiveness of sins (v.34b; Eze 36:25; Zec 3:4, 9; Ro 11:27). It is clear from the NT (e.g., Lk 22:20; 1Co 11:25; Heb 8-10) that the church—Gentiles and the spiritual remnant of Israel (Ro 11:1-16)—is today the recipient of the benefits promised to Israel in the new covenant. This is made possible only by God's sovereign, gracious grafting of Gentiles into that place of blessing (Ro 11:17-24). The cleansing referred to is related particularly to the fourth provision of the new covenant (see above) and is ultimately made possible through the atoning death of the pierced one (12:10).

#### v.2
>"On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.

That false prophecy was still a problem in the postexilic period is clear from Ne 6:12-14. That both idolatry and false prophecy would once again be a problem in the future is evident also in Mt 24:4-5, 11, 15, 23-24; 2Th 2:2-4; Rev 9:20; 13:4-15. The "spirit of impurity" that inspired the false prophets to lie will also be removed.

#### v.3
>And if anyone still prophesies, his father and mother, to whom he was born, will say to him, 'You must die, because you have told lies in the LORD's name.' When he prophesies, his own parents will stab him.

In the future day, if anyone dares to utter false prophecies ("lies"), his own parents—in obedience to Dt 13:6-9—will take the lead in executing him. The word "stab" indicates that the feelings and actions shown in piercing the Messiah will be directed toward the false prophets.

God hates liars. Our culture wilingly expenses half-truths in exchange for convenience and gain. God attributes those who lie in His name as deserving of imminent death.

#### v.9
>This third I will bring into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, 'They are my people,' and they will say, 'The LORD is our God.'"

See also [[1Peter1#v 7]].

The reward of our refinement and tribulation is simply 'to be His' one day. This is how bad God wants for a people to belong solely to Him. The climax of His jealousy for our love—refining, testing, and enduring—all points to His ultimate desire to reserve a people to just Himself. And this is all started, maintaind, and finished by the Author of Salvation. He is the writer of our stories—our beautifully crafted narrative of somehow displaying God's glory through our broken redeemed selves. Soli deo Gloria.
