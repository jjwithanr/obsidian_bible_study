# Zechariah 8

## Overview:
Zechariah here contrasts Israel's pasts judgement with her future restoration; she is to repent and live righteously because of the promise of her future restoration. 

#### v.2
>This is what the Lord Almighty says: "I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her."

Here the divine jealousy is directed towared the restoration of Israel.

#### v.8
>I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God."

The theological principle involved is that God is saving, forgiving, delivering, restoring Godâ€”one who delights to take "Not My People" and make them "My People." In the case of Gentiles, as in the church, he does this in his sovereign grace by grafting them into covenant relationship and blessing (Ro 11).

#### v.9
>This is what the LORD Almighty says: "You who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD Almighty, let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.

"Let your hands be strong" is a way of saying "be encouraged" (Jdg 7:11).

#### v.13
>As you have been an object of cursing among the nations, O Judah and Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong."

#### v.16-17
>These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts; <sup>17</sup>do not plot evil against your neighbor, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this," declares the LORD.

"Do not love" perjury is another way of exhorting the people to hate it. God hates perjury and wicked schemes to harm others (cf. Pr 6:16-19). One theological rationale for ethics is awareness that God hates attitudes and actions contrary to his character. **We must love what God loves and hate what he hates.**

#### v.21
>and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, 'Let us go at once to entreat the LORD and seek the LORD Almighty. I myself am going.'

#### v.23
>This is what the LORD Almighty says: "In those days ten men from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, 'Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.'" An Oracle

Israel will be the means whereby God draws the nations of the earth to the Lord in the time of the messianic kingdom.
