# Zechariah 11

## Overview:

#### v.8
>In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them

This much is certain: The Good Shepherd will dispose of all unfit leaders. In spite of the ideal ministry of the Good Shepherd, the flock as a whole detested him.

#### v.10-11
>Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. <sup>11</sup>It was revoked on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the LORD.

He revokes his covenant of security and restraint, by which he had been apparently holdinng back the nations from his people (cf. Eze 34:25; Hos 2:18). Now the nations (e.g., the Romans) will be permitted to overrun them.

#### v.12
>I told them, "If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it." So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.

"Give me my pay" speaks of the termination of the relationship; "keep it" is a more emphatic way of terminating the relationship. The "flock" (v.11) responds with thirty pieces of silver as the remuneration for the Shepherd's services. This sum was not only the price of a slave among the Israelites in ancient times (Ex 21:32) but also apparently a way of indicating a trifling amount.

#### v.16
>For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hoofs.

When one removes the "not" from the sentence, one has an enlightening description of a truly effective pastoral ministry in the church today: (1) "care for the lost", (2) "seek the young," (3) "heal the injured," (4) "feed the healthy."

· The foolish shepherd **will not care for those who are cut off** but a wise and godly shepherd will seek the lost.

· The foolish shepherd will not **seek the young** but a wise and godly shepherd knows that **the young** need to come to the LORD as much as older people do.

· The foolish shepherd will not **heal those that are broken** but a wise and godly shepherd looks for broken hearts and lives and mends them with God’s love and word.

· The foolish shepherd will not **feed those that still stand** but a wise and godly shepherd will faithfully feed the sheep.

· The foolish shepherd will **eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hooves in pieces** but a wise and godly shepherd will lay down his life for the sheep ([[John10#v 11]]).
