# Zechariah 10

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Ask the LORD for rain in the springtime; it is the LORD who makes the storm clouds. He gives showers of rain to men, and plants of the field to everyone.

This verse probably cotains a veiled polemic against Baal and Baalism (cf. Jer 14:22; Am 5:8). The Lord, not Baal, is the one who controls the weather and the rain, giving life and fertility to the land. Therefore the people of God are to pray to him and trust in him.

#### v.2
>The idols speak deceit, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd.

Prayer to God brings blessing (v.1), but trust in idols (or the false gods they represent) produces disappointment and sorrow.

#### v.3
>"My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD Almighty will care for his flock, the house of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle.

Since the earthly leaders are not taking proper care for them himself and to make them like a proud horse triumphant in battle.

#### v.4
>From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler.

This verse can explain why many first century priests were expecting the Messiah to be a Divine Warrior that will overthrow the Romans.

#### v.5
>Together they will be like mighty men trampling the muddy streets in battle. Because the LORD is with them, they will fight and overthrow the horsemen.

#### v.6
>"I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.

He does not half-forgive. "Their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more" [[Hebrews8#v 12]]. God casts off the sinner, as being what he is, a thing abhorrent, as penitence confesses of itself that it is "a dead dog, a loathsome worm, a putrid corpse." God will not clothe with a righteousness, which He does not impart. He restores to the penitent all his lost graces, as though he had never forfeited them, and cumulates them with the fresh grace whereby He converts him (see vol. i. on [[Joel2#v 25]], pp. 192, 193). It is an entire re-creation. "They shall be, as though I had not cast them off." "I will settle you as in your old estates, and will do good, more than at your beginnings, and ye shall know that I am the Lord" [[Ezekiel9#v 11]].
