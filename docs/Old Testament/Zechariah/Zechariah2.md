# Zechariah 2

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Then I looked up--and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand!

The cope of the restoration and blessing promised in this vision is such that its fulfillment must extend beyond the historical restoration period to the messianic kingdom era... The "measuring line" is a symbol of preparation for rebuliding and restoring Jerusalem and th etemple, ultimately in the messianic kingdom.The restoration of the people, the temple, and the city immediately after the Babylonian exile was only the first stage in the progressive fulfillment of the promises that follow.

#### v.8
>For this is what the LORD Almighty says: "After he has honored me and has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye—

The mission of this person is directed against the nations that have plundered God's chosen people. Such treatment of the Jews is condemned because harming them is like striking the apple of God's eye. "Apple" is the pupil, an extremely sensitive and vital part of the eye.

#### v.13
>Be still before the LORD, all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling."

He was about to break his apparent silence by acting in behalf of his elect. The first vision introduced the judgement and blessing motif. That motif is then developed in the second and third visions in alternating cycle: judgement for the nations (1:18-21) but blessing and glory for Israel (2:1-5); judgment for the nations (2:6-9) but blessing for Israel—and for the nations (2:10-13).
