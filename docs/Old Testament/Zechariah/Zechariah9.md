# Zechariah 9

## Overview:


#### v.1-2
>The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus-- for the eyes of men and all the tribes of Israel are on the LORD—<sup>2</sup>and upon Hamath too, which borders on it, and upon Tyre and Sidon, though they are very skillful.

As history shows, the agent of the Lord's judgement was Alexander the Great. After defeating the Persians (3333 B.C.), Alexander moved swiftly toward Egypt. On his march he toppled the cities in the Aramean (Syrian) interior, as well as those in on the Mediterranean coast. Yet, on coming to Jerusalem, he refused to destroy it. Verse 8 attributes this protection to the miraculous intervention of God.
