# Exodus 3

## Overview:

#### v.2
>There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.

#### v.5-6
>"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." <sup>6</sup>Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.

Because God was present, what had been ordinary became "holy ground" and consequently "set apart" for a distinct use. The place where sheep and goats had traveled just a short time ago was transformed into "holy ground" by God's presence. This is the first occurrence of the noun "hoy" (GK 7731) in Scripture (cf. Ge 2:3 for the verb form).
