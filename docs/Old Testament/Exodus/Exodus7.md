# Exodus 7

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.

While the Lord had made Moses as "God" to Aaron and Aaron in turn as his "prophet" (GK 5566) to the people, Moses was also ordained as  "God" to Pharoah in that he would speak and act with authority and power from above and Aaron would be Moses' "prophet" addressing Pharoah (cf. 4:15-16).
