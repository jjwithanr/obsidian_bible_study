# Exodus 4

## Overview:



#### v.10
>Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."

#### v.11
>The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?

#### v.12
>Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."

#### v.14
>Then the LORD's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.

#### v.16
>He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.

#### v.22
> Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son,

The passage artfully develops the issue of jeopardy to the firstborn: God’s first-born, Israel; Pharaoh’s firstborn; and Moses’ firstborn. Israel is God’s first-born in the sense that they are the first nation to enter into a relationship with him

#### v.24
>At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him.

When God discovers to us what is amiss in our lives, we must give all diligence to amend it speedily. This is the voice of every rod; it calls us to return to Him that smites us.

God was going to kill Moses because Moses was supposed to teach the Israelites God’s Law, yet Moses was not obeying God’s Law himself.

>and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
