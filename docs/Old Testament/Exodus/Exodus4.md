# Exodus 4

## Overview:



#### v.24
>At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him.

When God discovers to us what is amiss in our lives, we must give all diligence to amend it speedily. This is the voice of every rod; it calls us to return to Him that smites us.

God was going to kill Moses because Moses was supposed to teach the Israelites God’s Law, yet Moses was not obeying God’s Law himself.
