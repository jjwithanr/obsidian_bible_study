# Jeremiah 9

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Oh that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears! I would weep day and night for the slain of my people.

#### v.23
>"Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches,

#### v.24
>but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight," declares the Lord.

The knowledge of God relates to three leading attributes, the combination of which is very instructive. First, loving-kindness. This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination "loving-kindness and faithfulness" ([Psalm 85:10](https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm), corrected version), and as here (comp. [Psalm 5:7, 8](https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm); [Psalm 36:5, 6](https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm)), "mercy and righteousness." Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his "loving-kindness," vouchsafes. Next, judgment, or justice. Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. [Jeremiah 21:12](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm)). Then, righteousness - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence "righteousness" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the "plan of salvation." It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards.
