# Jeremiah 6

## Overview:


#### v.14
>They dress the wounds of my people as though it were not serious. 'Peace, peace,' they say, when there is no peace.

#### v.16
>This is what the Lord says: "Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, 'We will not walk in it.'

Grahm Foster introduced me to this verse when I asked him, "What advice would you give a young man who is trying to seek the Lord for direction in his life?" Look for the ancient paths. Read the stories of the saints from Hebrews 13 and learn about their lives. Seek humility rather than the path before you. **How can a humble man be outside of God's will?**
