# Nahum 1

## Overview:


#### v.2
>The Lord is a jealous and avenging God; the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath. The Lord takes vengeance on his foes and mountains his wrath against his enemies.

Against this covenantal background, it denotes **the Lord's deep, fiercely protective commitment** to his people, and his exhaustive claim to obedience and reciprocal commitement. Where this relationship of mutual commitment is threatened, either by Israel's unfaithfulness or by foreign oppression, the inevitable expressions of such jealousy are "vengeance" and "wrath," directed to restoring that relationship.

#### v.3
>The Lord is slow to anger and great in power; the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished. His way is in the whirlwind and the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet.

The Lord's anger is balanced by his forbearance, which represents a restraint born of meekness and not of weakness; it is not to be misunderstood as passivity. Nor is it exercised indefinitely, for his power assures that "he will not leave the guilty unpunished." The forbearance of God had been extended to Ninevah a century earlier in response to her repentance (Jn 3:10); but it was forfeited by her subsequent history of ruthless evil, making way for God's judgement instead.

#### v.6
>Who can withstand his indignation? Who can endure his fierce anger? His wrath is poured out like fire; the rocks are shattered before him.

#### v.7
>The Lord is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him,

The goodness of God forms a basic tenet of Israel's faith. Also, it repeatedly forms the basis for human faith, expressed in trusting obedience; **where the goodness of God is impugned with success, faith soon crumbles.** As an expression of covenant commitment to defend his people, the Lord himself is a "refuge" (GK 5057) or stronghold of protection. He "cares for" (lit., "knows"; GK 3359) the faithful, acknowledging their relationship to him and their claim on his goodness inherent in that relationship.

#### v.14
>The Lord has given a command concerning you, Ninevah; "You will have no descendants to bear your name. I will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods. I will prepare your grave, for you are vile."

#### v.15
>Look, there on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news, who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, O Judah, and fulfill your vows. No more will the wicked invade you; they will be completely destroyed.
