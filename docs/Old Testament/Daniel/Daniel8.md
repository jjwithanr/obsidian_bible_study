# Daniel 8

## Overview:


#### v.5
>As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.

The completeness of Alexander's victories is fittingly prefigured by this crushing attack on the ram. Alexander's conquest of the entire Near and Middle East within three years stands unique in military history and is appropriately portrayed by the lightning speed of this one-horned goat.

#### v.8
>The goat became very great, but at the height of its power the large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.

"The goat became very great" suggests Alexander's thrust beyond the borders of the empire he had conquered even into Afghanistan and Indus Valley (327 B.C.). Or it may refer to the growth in arrogance that led him to assume the pretensions to divinity that distressed his Macdeonian troops, who finally mutinied.

Yet, as v.8 predicts, "at the height of his \[the goat's\] power his large horn was broken off." Alexander died of a sudden fever brought on by dissipation (though it was rumored that he was actually poisoned by Cassander, the son of Antipater, viceroy of Macedonia) at Babylon in 323, at the age of thirty-three.

#### v.9
>Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.

This evidently refers to the career of Antiochus IV Epiphanes ("the Manifest/Conspicuous One"), who usurped the Seleucid throne from his nephew (son of his older brother, Seleucus IV) and succeeded in invading Egypt 170-169 B.C.
