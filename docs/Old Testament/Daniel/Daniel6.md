# Daniel 6

## Overview:


#### v.3
>Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.

#### v.5
>Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”

#### v.10
>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.

Prayer and fellowship with the Lord had safeguarded him from the corrupting influences of Babylonian culture. To preserve his in government and to save his own life, he would have to compromise his integrity by ceasing to pray to God or by praying privately. But faithful Daniel could not compromise. He would trust the Lord for deliverance. His habit had been to pray regularly toward Jerusalem, the focal point of his hopes and prayers for the progress of the kingdom of God.

#### v.11
>Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.

#### v.22
>My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you O king."

#### v.23
>The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

#### v.28
>So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

After this, Daniel apparently retired from public service and gave himself to the study of the Scriptures and to prayer. He received the revelations of chs. 10-12 in the third year of Cyrus (cf 10:1).
