# Daniel 9

## Overview:


#### v.2
>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.

Scripture is meant to be understood. Clarity of Scripture.
#jj research quote from Wayne Grudem

#### v.3
>So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes.

The impact of the revelation of the gap between the prophetic promises and the current crises moves the heart of the renewed man to his knees and humility. Prophecy is revelation of the need God intends to fulfill. When we align with it, the fulfillment of such prophecy becomes our need since it is God's will.

#### v.5
>we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws.

"We". Daniel included himself with the people and their sin.

#### v.8
>We and our kings, our princes and our ancestors are covered with shame, Lord, because we have sinned against you.

Sin has effects beyond personal conviction. It's so disgusting that it infects leaders and entire generations with shame and concealment of seeing God rightly.

#### v.9
>The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;

We can only appeal to the Judge whom we have rebelled against for forgiveness. If we have sinned against God, it is only God who can forgive such sins.

#### v.13
>Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth.

Here it means, that, as a people, they had failed, when they had sinned, to call upon God for pardon; to confess their sins; to implore his mercy; to deprecate his wrath. It would have been easy to turn aside his threatened judgments if they had been penitent, and had sought his mercy, but they had not done it. What is here said of them can and will be said of all sinners when the Divine judgment comes upon them.

#### v.14
>The Lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster on us, for the Lord our God is righteous in everything he does; yet we have not obeyed him.

His judgements are not good or bad. They are right.

#### v.17
>“Now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant. For your sake, Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.

The glory of God is at stake.

#### v.18
>Give ear, our God, and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your Name. We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.

Peter Kim said this a lot.

#### v.22
>He instructed me and said to me, “Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.

#### v.27
>He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.' In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.
