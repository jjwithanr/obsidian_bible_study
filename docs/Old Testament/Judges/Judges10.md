#### v.15-16
>But the Israelites said to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best, but please rescue us now." <sup>16</sup> Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the LORD. And he could bear Israel's misery no longer.

A genuine cry for mercy liberates us from expectation of how God shall deal with our sins. We appeal to His eternal characteristics of lovingkindness towards humanityâ€”not His outward pattern of redemption.
