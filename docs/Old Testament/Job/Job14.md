#### v.5

#### v.6

#### v.7
>"At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.

#### v.9

#### v.10

#### v.19
>as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.

#### v.20
>You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.

#### v.21
>If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.
