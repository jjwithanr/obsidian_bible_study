# Job 9

## Overview:


#### v.20
>Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.

#### v.33-35
>If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both, <sup>34</sup>someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more. <sup>35</sup>Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.

In v.33 Job touched on the mystery through which God would eventually provide godliness for man. He yearned for a mediator ("someone to arbitrate"; GK 3519) between himself and God. Such a person would not have to be one who stands over both God and Job in order to judge between them. As "one who argues a case," he is a negotiator who is able to bring parties together. We should not infer from this that the book of Job here is directly predictive of the NT doctrine of Christ as mediator. For one thing Job was not looking for a mediator to forgive him of his sins so that he might be received by God; Job was yearning for a mediator who could prove that he was innocent and could somehow be effective with God despite his infinite power and wisdom. But having said that, we have here a rudimentary idea that is certainly evocative of that NT concept. This idea will move on to greater ramifications in 16:20-21 and 19:25-26.
