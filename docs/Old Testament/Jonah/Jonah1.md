# Jonah 1

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.5
>All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.

What we turn to in times of fear exposes our allegiance - and our idols.
