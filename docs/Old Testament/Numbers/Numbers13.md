#### v.18
>See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.


#### v.19
>What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?


#### v.20
>How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)

#### v.25
>At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.

>They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.


#### v.28
>But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.

>The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."


#### v.30
>Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."


#### v.31
>But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."


#### v.32
>And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.


#### v.33
>We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."
