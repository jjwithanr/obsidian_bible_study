#### v.3

#### v.4

#### v.5

#### v.7
>Then Balaam uttered his oracle: "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. `Come,' he said, `curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'

#### v.8
>How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?

#### v.9
>From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.

#### v.10
>Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!"

#### v.11
>Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!"

#### v.12
>He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"

#### v.13
>Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me."

#### v.14
>So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

#### v.15
>Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there."

#### v.16
>The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."

#### v.17

#### v.18
>Then he uttered his oracle: "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.

#### v.19
>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?

#### v.20
>I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.

#### v.21
>"No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.

#### v.22

#### v.23
>There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, `See what God has done!'

>The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims."

#### v.25
>Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!"

#### v.26
>Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?"

#### v.27
