# Obadiah

## Overview:



#### v.3
>The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, 'Who can bring me down to the ground?'

"Pride" (GK 2295) is derived from a verb meaning "to boil up, seethe"; the root of this word occurs three times in the account of Esau's squandered birthright. The essence of this "pride" is insubordination, rooted in an inordinate self-estimation: the proud man rejects authority, wehther from God or another human being, and arrogates it to himself.

**The heart has its own language**, as distinct and as definite as that formed by the lips, mostly deeper, often truer. It needeth not the language of the lips, to offend God. **ðŸ”¥Since He answers the heart which seeks Him, so also He replies in displeasure to the heart which despises Him.**

#### v.7
>All your allies will force you to the border; your friends will deceive and overpower you; those who eat your bread will set a trap for you, but you will not detect it.

The meaning, "they will make your bread a trap" is interpreted as a synecdoche (i.e. a part for the whole): they make the friendship expressed and ratified when they ate your bread a trap.
