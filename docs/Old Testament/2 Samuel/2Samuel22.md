## Overview:


#### v.1
>David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.

#### v.2
>He said: "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;

#### v.20

#### v.21
>"The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.

In verses 21–25 David appears to claim moral perfection and unwavering allegiance to the Lord’s covenant demands. But surely, given his moral failures and shortcomings, David is not claiming to be innocent in an absolute sense. **David speaks here in general terms, using covenant terminology that derives from a context where only two extremes (loyalty and disloyalty) exist.** As he reflects on his life, he asserts that loyalty to the Lord has characterized his attitudes and actions. Three observations support this interpretation: (1) The heading (v. 1) and style of the song indicate that David is generalizing about his experience. In verses 4–20 he treats his many narrow escapes as if they were one great event in which he experiences divine deliverance. In verses 33–46 he describes his numerous battles as if they were one decisive conflict. (2) Later in the Former Prophets, reflection on David’s career casts him in the role of a loyal, even paradigmatic, follower of the Lord (1 Kings 3:3, 6, 14; 9:4; 11:4, 6, 33–34, 38; 14:8; 15:3, 5, 11; 2 Kings 14:3; 16:2; 18:3; 22:2). (3) In portraying attitudes toward the Lord, the psalms consistently speak of two groups, the righteous and the wicked. In this song these two groups are clearly differentiated (vv. 26–28). Though David at times failed to walk in accordance with God’s covenant, he demonstrated in his attitudes and actions an allegiance to the Lord that was in contrast to the consistent anticovenant behavior of the wicked.

#### v.22
>For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.

#### v.23
>All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.

#### v.24
>I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.

#### v.25
>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.

#### v.26
>"To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,

#### v.27
>to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.

The point is that God sometimes uses deception to thwart the purposes of those who are morally and ethically corrupt. The word translated “devious” (‘iqqesh) refers to those who are morally “twisted,” or perverse. The Proverbs frequently use the term of evil men and their words, thoughts, and actions (Prov. 2:15; 8:8; 11:20; 17:20; 19:1; 22:5; 28:6). Their actions are the antithesis of just and upright behavior (8:8; 11:20; 19:1; 28:6). As one reflects on David’s career, one can detect the providential “deceit” of God at work on David’s behalf on several occasions (1 Sam. 16:2–3; 19:11–17; 2 Sam. 16:16–19; 17:7–14).

#### v.28
>You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.

#### v.29
>You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light.

#### v.30
>With your help I can advance against a troop ; with my God I can scale a wall.

#### v.31
>"As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.

Here David alludes to the numerous occasions when he inquired of the Lord and received a reliable oracle of victory or protection (1 Sam. 23:2, 4–5, 10–12; 30:8; 2 Sam. 5:19).
