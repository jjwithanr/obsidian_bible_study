# 2 Samuel 19

## Overview:


#### v.21
>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this?" He cursed the Lord's anointed."

#### v.23
>So the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king promised him on oath.

“Your Majesty would have a perfect right to strike off his head," said Peridan. "Such an assault as he made puts him on a level with assassins."  
"It is very true," said Edmund. "But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did." And he looked very thoughtful.”

 Later, on his deathbed, David is not so merciful. He advises Solomon to make sure Shimei dies violently ([1 Kings 2:8–9](1Kings2#v.8)). This makes one wonder about David’s motives in sparing Shimei now. He may be afraid of the Benjamites, who have turned out in large numbers. However, it is more likely that this pardon is designed to communicate to Benjamin and the northern tribes his willingness to let bygones be bygones. If David can pardon Shimei, then certainly he will welcome them back as his supporters.
