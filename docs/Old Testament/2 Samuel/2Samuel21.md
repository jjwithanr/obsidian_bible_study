# 2 Samuel 21

## Overview:


#### v.1
>During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, "It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death."

#### v.2
>The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to \[spare\] them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)

#### v.3
>David asked the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD's inheritance?"

#### v.4
>The Gibeonites answered him, "We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death." "What do you want me to do for you?" David asked.

#### v.5
>They answered the king, "As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,

#### v.6
>let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul—the Lord's chosen one." So the king said, "I will give them to you."

In this episode David, with the Lord’s approval, allows the Gibeonites to execute seven of Saul’s male descendants because of Saul’s crimes against that city. Is it just for God to punish children for the sins of their ancestors? The Old Testament teaches that individuals do sometimes suffer the consequences of their forebears’ deeds. The Lord warns his enemies that their sin will have negative consequences for their families through three or four generations (Exod. 20:5; 34:7; Num. 14:18). Dathan’s, Abiram’s, and Achan’s innocent children died along with their sinful parents (Num. 16:27, 32 \[apparently Korah’s sons were spared: Num. 26:11]; Josh. 7:24). The Lord also took the lives of four of David’s sons because of his sin against Uriah (2 Sam. 12:5–6, 10; cf. 12:14–15; 13:28–29; 18:15; 1 Kings 2:25). Though Jeremiah anticipates a day when God’s judgment will operate on a strictly individual basis, he assumes that God has judged the children for their ancestors’ sins in the past (31:29–30; cf. Lam. 5:7). However, the Old Testament law says a son should not be executed for his father’s sin (Deut. 24:16; cf. 2 Kings 14:6). Ezekiel 18 seems to suggest that God himself abides by this principle and judges a person on the basis of the person’s own actions, not those of the parents.
How can this apparent contradiction be harmonized? In each case in which children are punished for their parents’ sin, direct rebellion against God is in view. (The Israelites made a solemn oath before God that they would live in peace with the Gibeonites \[Josh. 9:18–20].) Because of the principle of corporate solidarity, the sovereign God of the universe has the freedom to judge a couple’s descendants when divine authority has been directly challenged, but God does not allow humans—being finite and prone to injustice and excessive vengeance—that same freedom in civil cases.
Ezekiel 18 deals with a somewhat different situation. Here the hypothetical children in the illustrations are actively pursuing evil or righteousness in their daily lives. These exiles can rest assured that their forebears’ character will not negate their own behavior, for better or worse. For Ezekiel’s generation, this is the important principle to recognize. They are not mere victims of God’s judgment on their fathers and mothers. They too are sinners and need to take personal responsibility for their own actions. God in his grace has preserved them. He has given them opportunity to repent of their evil and to do what is right. Through the prophet Ezekiel, God assures the exiles that he will reward a proper response, regardless of their ancestors’ shortcomings.
