# Ecclesiastes 7

## Overview:


#### v.3
>Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.

#### v.4
>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.

#### v.10
>Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it is not wise to ask such questions.

People have always looked back to the good old days. Even Christians sometimes overestimate the early church, the Reformation, or periods of revival. Wise people certainly learn from the past, but they live in the present with all its opportunities. Overmuch dwelling on the past can prevent us from overcoming the world, which often seems so much more wicked today than ever before.

#### v.13-14
>Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked? <sup>14</sup>When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.

The reference to God's "making crooked" (GK 6430) stresses his sovereign control over all events. There are some things that we cannot alter. As children of God, we commonly experience both good and bad and may even thank God for allowing hardships rather than givign us an entirely smooth passage (cf. Mt 8:20; Lk 10:38; 2Co 1:4-7). Part of the life of faith is accepting prosperity and adversity from God's hand without being able to explain just how everything will be worked out for the future ([Ro 8:28](Romans8#v.28)).

#### v.18
>It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all \[extremes\].

Wisdom is not the knowledge of accumulated facts but the inner strength that comes from a God-instructed conscience. There is a link between the fear of God and the true wisdom that gives inner strength (v.10; cf. Pr 9:10), which is here contrasted with mere power.
