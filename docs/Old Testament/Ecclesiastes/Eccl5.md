# Ecclesiastes 5

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.

We seek his guidance and listen to his words. The alternative is to suppose that offerings can be a substitute for a God-ordered life. Sometimes extreme concern over one issue is an unconscious screen against facing other issues. It is as though we call God's attention to the sacrifice we are making while being blind to some essential command that he makes.

#### v.2
>Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.

The emphasis in v.2 is on rashness and haste. Prayer is not reciting a list as quickly as possible so as to rush once more into the round of daily life (cf. Mt 6:7-8).

#### v.3
>As a dream comes when there are many cares, so the speech of a fool when there are many words.

As personal and business cares produce dreams, which are unsubstantial things, so many words produce foolish and empty prayer. When we come before God, our minds are full of our own business rather than with the worship of God. When we talk too much, we usually talk like fools. This can especially bad in the house of God.

I had personally wrestled with the part of my nature that talks a lot. I seem to say whatever comes to my mind. I reasoned that if God created me this way, He would not deem something inherent as sinful. Yet, as I comb through Scriptures (esp. Proverbs), I am realizing that speaking many words is dangerous. I am learning to die to self so I can speak words that brings wisdom, healing, and most importantly, glory to God.

#### v.4
>When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow.

God takes no pleasure in fools.

#### v.5
>It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.

See also cost of discipleship in [[Luke14#v.29-30]]. 

#### v.6
>Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the \[temple\] messenger, "My vow was a mistake." Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?

#### v.7
>Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of God.

#### v.12
>The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep.

#### v.18
>Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given him—for this is his lot.

The Teacher has described those who aim for money and lose real life. Can we then have life first and secondarily find a place for money? The refrain says yes, if we take life day by day from God and seek to know his plan, so far as it may be known. We must be willing to work.

#### v.19
>Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work—this is a gift of God.

We must also look for constructive uses of leisure—activity that may not bring much money but will bring the added enjoyment that the Teacher has in mind. Therefore, it is right to pray and to look for work that will produce enough to live on and possessions we can enjoy with a good conscience, because they are things God has given us to enjoy (1Ti 6:17).

#### v.20
>He seldom reflects on the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness of heart.

In summary, the ideal for those devoted to God is that they not brood over the past or worry about the future; for God fills their hearts with joy (cf. Mt 6:25-34; Php 4:4-7).
