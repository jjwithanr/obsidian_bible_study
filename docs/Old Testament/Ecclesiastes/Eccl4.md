# Ecclesiastes 4

## Overview:


#### v.4
>And I saw that all labor and achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

#### v.5-6
>The fool folds his hands and ruins himself. <sup>6</sup>Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.

To ignore the drive for achievement and become a dropout is foolish self-destructiveness. But the drive must be harnessed to what is compatible with inner peace.
