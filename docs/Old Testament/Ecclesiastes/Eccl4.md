# Ecclesiastes 4

## Overview:


#### v.4
>And I saw that all labor and achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

#### v.5-6
>The fool folds his hands and ruins himself. <sup>6</sup>Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.

To ignore the drive for achievement and become a dropout is foolish self-destructiveness. But the drive must be harnessed to what is compatible with inner peace.

#### v.7-8
>Again I saw something meaningless under the sun: <sup>8</sup>There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaninglessâ€”a miserable business!
