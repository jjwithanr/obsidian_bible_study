# Ecclesiastes 2

## Overview:


#### v.11
>Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.

#### v.13
>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.

#### v.24-25
>A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, <sup>25</sup>for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?

Similar to [[1Timothy6#v.17]].

#### v.26
>To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
