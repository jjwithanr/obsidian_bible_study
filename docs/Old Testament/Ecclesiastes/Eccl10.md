# Ecclesiastes 10

## Overview:


#### v.1
>As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.

#### v.4
>If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.

Do not give in to self-pity upon receiving harsh feedback.

#### v.10
>If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success.

#### v.12
>Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.

#### v.19
>A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.

Food and wine occupy the minds of lazy rulers, and they behave as though money can buy everything.

#### v.20
>Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
