# Lamentations 3

## Overview:


#### v.8
>Even when I call out or cry for help, he shuts out my prayer.

#### v.16
>He has broken my teeth with gravel; he has trampled me in the dust.

What a figure to express _disgust, pain_, and the consequent incapacity of _taking food_ for the support of life; a man, instead of bread, being obliged to eat _small pebbles_ till all his teeth are _broken to pieces_ by endeavouring to grind them. One can scarcely read this description without feeling the _toothache_.

#### v.19
>I remember my affliction and my wandering, the bitterness and the gall.

God also remembers our wanderings. See [[Psalm56#v 8]].
#jj 

#### v.20-21
>I well remember them, and my soul is downcast within me. <sup>21</sup>Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope:

It is evident that in the preceding verses there is a _bitterness_ of _complaint_ against the _bitterness_ of _adversity_, that is not becoming to _man_ when under the chastising hand of God; and, while indulging this feeling, all _hope_ fled. Here we find a different feeling; he _humbles_ himself under the mighty hand of God, and then his _hope_ revives.

At the south of Africa the sea was generally so stormy, when the frail barks of the Portuguese went sailing south, that they named it the Cape of Storms; but after that cape had been well rounded by bolder navigators, they named it the Cape of Good Hope. In your experience you had many a Cape of Storms, but you have weathered them all, and now, let them be a Cape of Good Hope to you.
#spurgeon 

#### v.22
>Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.

See where Jeremiah gets his comfort; he seems to say, ‘Bad as my case is, it might have been worse, for I might have been consumed, and **I should have been consumed if the Lord’s compassions had failed.**’
#spurgeon 

#### v.23
>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.

Each dawning day gives mankind hope in fresh **mercies** and **compassions** from God. We need a constant supply and God has promised to send them without fail. No matter how bad the past day was, God’s people can look to the new **morning** with faith and hope.
#enduringword 

Our treasures, which we lay up on earth, are the stagnant pools; but the treasure which God gives us from heaven, in providence and in grace, is the crystal fount which wells up from the eternal deeps, and is always fresh and always new.
#spurgeon 

#### v.24
>I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."

The poet said in effect, that he has had so little of this world’s goods and pleasures because his share has been the Lord.
#ellison

#### v.25
>The LORD is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him;

All the misery of God’s people had come because they would not truly seek God and **wait for Him**. They rejected and rebelled for generations, then looked to others for rescue. Seeking Him again would bring renewed expressions of His goodness.
#enduringword 

Do not be in a hurry; do not expect to be delivered out of your trouble the first time you begin to cry unto God. Oh, no: ‘the Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.’
#spurgeon 

In these three verses, **each beginning in the Hebrew with the word good**, we have first the fundamental idea that Yahweh Himself is good, and if good to all, then especially is He so to those who being in adversity can yet wait in confidence upon His mercy.

My cynicism used to justify itself by my experience in waiting upon God amidst my sufferings in life. I questioned God much when I played sports throughout junior high and high school, when I processed family members' funerals, when EFCLA fired Andy, and when Edward left the faith. Yet, this verse illuminates the heart of God amidst our sufferings: He is good to those who are in the thick of it all. He is good. Especially in the waiting. 
This season of Spring Quarter 2022 my senior year at UCI has also been one of waiting. I've taken on so much this last quarter - especially oap. And I remember on week 4 feeling the weight of all the burdens I was carrying. Yet, the Lord is good to those who wait upon Him. Even as I'm writing this at the end of week 9, I remind myself: the Lord is good to those whose hope is in him and seeks him.
#jj 

#### v.26
>it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.

#### v.27
>It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.

There are seasons of adversity, and sometimes it is better to have those seasons when one is young. If God disciplines us when we are young, it is to train us for a fruitful future.
#enduringword 

Early _habits_, when good, are invaluable. Early _discipline_ is equally so. He who has not got under wholesome restraint in youth will never make a useful man, a good man, nor a happy man.
#clarke 

By bearing a yoke in his youth, i. e. being called upon to suffer in early age, a man learns betimes the lesson of silent endurance, and so finds it **more easy to be calm and patient in later years.**
#barnes 

Thank you Lord for teaching me so much about character and godliness through team sport at RHP. Thank you for teaching me how to love the youth well at Banner Church. Thank you for sharing your burdens with me at UCI. Thank you for humbling me in oap to depend on you wholeheartedly.

See also [[1Peter4#v 1]].

#### v.31
>For men are not cast off by the Lord forever.

#### v.32
>Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love.

#### v.33
>For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.

It is no pleasure to God to afflict men. He takes no delight in our pain and misery: yet, like a tender and intelligent parent, he uses the rod; not to gratify himself, but to profit and save us.
#clarke 

#### v.38
>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?

#### v.39
>Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?

If I hate sin because of the punishment, I have not repented of my sin, I merely regret that God is just.
#spurgeon 

#### v.44
>You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.

#### v.48
>Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.

#### v.51
>What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.

#### v.57
>You came near when I called you, and you said, "Do not fear."

How powerful is this word when spoken by the Spirit of the Lord to a disconsolate heart. To _every mourner_ we may say, on the authority of God, _Fear not_! God will plead thy cause, and redeem thy soul.

#### v.64
>Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, for what their hands have done.

What a chapter: from deep anguish to aspiring hope to a concluding imprecatory prayer. Jeremiah is GOING THROUGH it.
