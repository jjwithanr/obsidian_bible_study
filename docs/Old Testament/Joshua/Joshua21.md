# Joshua 21

## Overview:


#### v.41-43
>The towns of the Levites in the territory held by the Israelites were forty-eight in all, together with their pasturelands. <sup>42</sup>Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns. <sup>43</sup>So the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled there.



#### v.43-45
>So the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled there. <sup>44</sup>The LORD gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their forefathers. Not one of their enemies withstood them; the LORD handed all their enemies over to them. <sup>45</sup>Not one of all the LORD's good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.

The statement "the LORD gave Israel" emphasizes God's sovereign action, but Israel's obedient participation was essential... God's oath to Abraham had now been fulfilled... God had not promised immediate destruction of the Canaanites but only their gradual extermination ([Ex 23:30](Exodus23#v.30); [Dt 7:22](Deut7#v.22)).
