# Micah 1

## Overview:


#### v.13
>You who live in Lachish, harness the team to the chariot. You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.

Scripture does not give the genealogy of her sin, but stamps her as the heresiarch of Judah. We know the fact from this place only, that she, apparently so removed from the occasion of sin, became, like the propagators of heresy, the authoress of evil, the cause of countless loss of souls.

#### v.16
>Shave your heads in mourning for the children in whom you delight; make yourselves as bald as the vulture, for they will go from you into exile.

Shaving the hair also functions as a sign of mourning (Jer 41:5) as well as a part of purification rituals (Lev 14:8-9; Num 6:9).
