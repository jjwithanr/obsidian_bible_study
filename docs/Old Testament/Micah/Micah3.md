# Micah 3

## Overview:


#### v.2-3
>you who hate good and love evil; who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones; <sup>3</sup>who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?"

He pictures the civil leaders as treating the exploited classes like animals being butchered and prepared for eating...Because they had so treated the poor, the Lord would not hear these merciless authorities when they cried to him. Those who violate God's covenant cannot expect him to maintain the blessings of the covenant.

The realistic aspects of preparing the flesh and cracking the bones for their marrow may well be based on the necessities of survival during famines or military sieges (see comment on 2 Kings 6:29).

#### v.5
>This is what the Lord says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, if one feeeds them, they proclaim 'peace'; if he does not, they prepare to wage war against him.

The word "feeds" (lit., "bites"; GK 5966) is always used in the OT for the bite of a serpent - except where the root reflects the secondary connotation of paying interest on loaned money. Its primary use has led some to interpret the phrase as describing the harm inflicted on the people by the lying prophets, whose false message of peace was as harmful as a serpent's bite.
