# Micah 6

## Overview:


#### v.2
> Listen, you mountains, to the case of Yahweh, And you enduring foundations of the earth, Because Yahweh has a case against His people; Even with Israel He will reprove.

#### v.8
>He has showed you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.

What God wants is a heart response to God demonstrated in the basic elements of true religion... "To love mercy \[GK 2876\]" is freely and willingly to show kindness to others. "To walk humbly \[GK 7570\] with your God" means to live in conscious fellowship with him, exercising a spirit of humility before him. The prophet was not indicating that sacrifice was completely ineffectual and that simply a proper attitude to God would suffice. Rather, God has no interest in the multiplication of empty religious acts.
