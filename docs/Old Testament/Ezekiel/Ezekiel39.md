# Ezekiel 39

## Overview:


#### v.7
>“‘I will make known my holy name among my people Israel. I will no longer let my holy name be profaned, and the nations will know that I the Lord am the Holy One in Israel.

#### v.17
>“Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: ‘Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood.

#### v.22
>From that day forward the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God.

#### v.23
>And the nations will know that the people of Israel went into exile for their sin, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.

#### v.26
>They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed toward me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid.

#### v.29
>I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the people of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.”

“Finally, [Ezekiel 36:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Ezekiel+36.27&t=NKJV) is reiterated with the powerful statement, put in the prophetic perfect tense, that _I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel_ (RV). To put this in the future (as RSV) weakens the dramatic force of this assertion. True, God had not yet done this in reality; but it was such an assured word that it could be spoken by Ezekiel as if it were an accomplished fact.” (Taylor)
