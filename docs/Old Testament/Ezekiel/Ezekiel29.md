## Overview:

#### v.1
>In the tenth year, in the tenth month on the twelfth day, the word of the LORD came to me:

#### v.2
>"Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.

#### v.3
>Speak to him and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: "'I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, you great monster lying among your streams. You say, "The Nile is mine; I made it for myself."

#### v.4
>But I will put hooks in your jaws and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales. I will pull you out from among your streams, with all the fish sticking to your scales.

#### v.5
>I will leave you in the desert, you and all the fish of your streams. You will fall on the open field and not be gathered or picked up. I will give you as food to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air.

#### v.6
>Then all who live in Egypt will know that I am the LORD. "'You have been a staff of reed for the house of Israel.

#### v.7
>When they grasped you with their hands, you splintered and you tore open their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and their backs were wrenched.

#### v.8
>"'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will bring a sword against you and kill your men and their animals.

#### v.9
>Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the LORD. "'Because you said, "The Nile is mine; I made it,"

#### v.21
>"On that day I will make a horn grow for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."

In the only other place where the expression “make a horn grow” occurs, the horn refers to a king in David’s line: “Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one” [(Ps. 132:17](Psalm132#v.17); compare [Dan. 7:24](Daniel7#v.24) and [Rev. 17:9–11](Revelation17#v.9), where horns represent kings). But the remainder of the verse suggests another reference: “I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.” In [24:27](Ezekeil24#v.27), the Lord promises to open Ezekiel’s mouth—that is, to remove the prophet’s inability to intercede for Israel (see the discussion of [3:26](Ezekiel3#v.26))—once Jerusalem has fallen. The Lord fulfills that promise in [33:22](Ezekiel33#v.22), and in Ezekiel 34–48 messages of hope and restoration displace oracles of judgment. Verse 21 foreshadows the message of salvation that will dominate those later chapters (compare [28:25–26](Ezekiel28#v.25-26)). As the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi and many others since have affirmed, the “horn . . . for the house of Israel” (v. 21) is “a general reference to an approaching deliverance for Israel” (Zimmerli, Ezekiel 2, p. 120).
