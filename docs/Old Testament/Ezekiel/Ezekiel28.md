# Ezekiel 28

## Overview:


#### v.2
>“Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “ ‘In the pride of your heart you say, “I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas.” But you are a mere mortal and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.

Claiming equality with Yahweh was the sin that casted Lucifer down from heaven.

#### v.3
>Are you wiser than Daniel ? Is no secret hidden from you?

Even in his own day, Daniel was famous for his wisdom ([Daniel 1:20](Daniel1#v.20), [2:20](Daniel2#v.20), and [2:48](Daniel2#v.48)) and God-given insight. This arrogant claim further exposed the pride of the prince of Tyre.

iii. The example of Daniel is also meaningful because Daniel “was a classic example of a man whose head was not turned by his success.” (Taylor)

#### v.4-5
>By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries. <sup>5</sup>By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.

Simple proverbs have enabled the King of Tyre to be successful but he let the affluency grow pride in his heart. His heart was not guarded.

"Where has my heart grown proud, God?"

Ministry. Ministry does not point to YOUR glory. It shows MY glory. Do whatever it takes to give the glory to me alone, JJ.

#### v.13-15
>You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created they were prepared. <sup>14</sup>You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. <sup>15</sup>You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.

#### v.16
>Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.

Everything looked good on the outside until you were sought out and exposed for your violence.

Traditional Christian interpretation has read Ezek. 28, like Isa. 14, as referring to the fall of Satan. Tertullian (155–230 A.D.) cited Ezek. 28 as proof that Satan was created good and became corrupt through his own choices (Marc. 2.10), while Theodoret of Cyprus (393–457 A.D.) wrote, “Forcing the text, someone might apply these things even to the historical prince of Tyre, but the text truly and properly corresponds to that demon which produces sinfulness.”

#### v.17
>Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.

#### v.21
>"On that day I will make a horn grow for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord."

In the only other place where the expression “make a horn grow” occurs, the horn refers to a king in David’s line: “Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one” [(Ps. 132:17](Psalm132#v.17); compare [Dan. 7:24](Daniel7#v.24) and [Rev. 17:9–11](Revelation17#v.9), where horns represent kings). But the remainder of the verse suggests another reference: “I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.” In [24:27](Ezekeil24#v.27), the Lord promises to open Ezekiel’s mouth—that is, to remove the prophet’s inability to intercede for Israel (see the discussion of [3:26](Ezekiel3#v.26))—once Jerusalem has fallen. The Lord fulfills that promise in [33:22](Ezekiel33#v.22), and in Ezekiel 34–48 messages of hope and restoration displace oracles of judgment. Verse 21 foreshadows the message of salvation that will dominate those later chapters (compare [28:25–26](Ezekiel28#v.25-26)). As the medieval Jewish commentator Rashi and many others since have affirmed, the “horn . . . for the house of Israel” (v. 21) is “a general reference to an approaching deliverance for Israel” (Zimmerli, Ezekiel 2, p. 120).
