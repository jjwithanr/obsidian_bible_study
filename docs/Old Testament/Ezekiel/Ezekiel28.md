# Ezekiel 28

## Overview:


#### v.2
>“Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: “ ‘In the pride of your heart you say, “I am a god; I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the seas.” But you are a mere mortal and not a god, though you think you are as wise as a god.

Claiming equality with Yawheh was the sin that casted Lucifer down from heaven.

#### v.3
>Are you wiser than Daniel ? Is no secret hidden from you?

Even in his own day, Daniel was famous for his wisdom ([Daniel 1:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Daniel+1.20&t=NKJV), [2:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Daniel+2.20&t=NKJV), and [2:48](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Daniel+2.48&t=NKJV)) and God-given insight. This arrogant claim further exposed the pride of the prince of Tyre.

iii. The example of Daniel is also meaningful because Daniel “was a classic example of a man whose head was not turned by his success.” (Taylor)

#### v.4-5
>By your wisdom and understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and amassed gold and silver in your treasuries. <sup>5</sup>By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, and because of your wealth your heart has grown proud.

Simple proverbs have enabled the King of Tyre to be successful but he let the affluency grow pride in his heart. His heart was not guarded.

"Where has my heart grown proud, God?"

Ministry. Ministry does not point to YOUR glory. It shows MY glory. Do whatever it takes to give the glory to me alone, JJ.

#### v.16
>Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.

Everything looked good on the outside until you were sought out and exposed for your violence.
#jj 

#### v.17
>Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.
