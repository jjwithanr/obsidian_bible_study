# Ezekiel 14

## Overview:


#### v.3
>"Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all?

These leaders outwardly sought God's will by coming to Ezekiel, a true spokesman for the Lord. At the same time, however, they inwardly were exalting idols on the throne of their hearts as the real ogods of their lives. Theirs was a fickle twofold allegiance.

#### v.6
>"Therefore say to the house of Israel, 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Repent! Turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices!

#### v.14
>even if these three men - Noah, Daniel, and Job - were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign Lord.

God reminded the elders that any nation that was unfaithful to him and turned to other gods would be punished, for God remains faithful to both his covenant curses and covenant promises (Lev 26:22-26).
