# Ezekiel 21

## Overview:


#### v.3
>and say to her: "This is what the Lord says: I am against you. I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.

“The teaching here regarding the cutting off of both righteous and wicked does not contradict the teaching of chapter 18 that only the soul that sins shall die (cf. [Ezekiel 18:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Ezekiel+18.20&t=NKJV)). The former passage spoke of final judgment, while this passage speaks of temporal judgment. As regards final judgment, the righteous will not be destroyed along with the wicked. In temporal judgments, however, both often suffer equally.” (Smith)

#### v.6
>"Therefore, groan, son of man! Groan beforoe them with broken heart and bitter grief.

#### v.32
>You will be fuel for the fire, your blood will be shed in your land, you will be remembered no more; for I the Lord have spoken.' "

“Their ultimate fate will be worse than Israel’s and worse even than Egypt’s, for they will be _no more remembered_. To the Semitic mind nothing could be more terrible: no prospect of restoration, no continuance in succeeding generations, no memorial, not even a memory. Oblivion.” (Taylor)
