# Amos 3

## Overview:



#### v.7
>Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.

#### v.8
>The lion has roared - who will not fear? The Sovereign Lord has spoken - who can but prophesy?

there is cause for you to fear, when the Lord "roareth from Zion;" but if ye fear not, God's prophets dare not but fear. So Paul saith, "necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel! For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, a dispensation" of the Gospel "is committed unto me" [1 Corinthians 9:16-17](1Cor9#v.16); and Peter and John, "whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye! For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard" [Acts 4:19-20](Acts4#v.19-20); Moses was not excused, though slow of speech; nor Isaiah, though of polluted lips; nor Jeremiah, because he was a child; but God said, "Say not, I am child, for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee, thou shalt speak" [Jeremiah 1:7](Jeremiah1#v.7). And Ezekiel was bidden, "be not rebellious, like that rebellious house" [Ezekiel 2:8](Ezekiel2#v.8). And when Jeremiah would keep silence, he saith, "His Word was in mine heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing and I could not stay" [Jeremiah 20:9](Jeremiah20#v.9).

God will destroy our vacation homes too.
