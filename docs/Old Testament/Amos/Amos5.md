# Amos 5

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.18
>Woe to you who long for the day of the Lord! Why do you long for the day of the Lord?

It may be, however, that they who scoffed at Amos, cloked their unbelief under the form of desiring the good days, which God had promised by Joel afterward. Jerome: "There is not," they would say, "so much of evil in the captivity, as there is of good in what the Lord has promised afterward." Amos meets the hypocrisy or the scoff, by the appeal to their consciences, "to what end is it to you?" **They had nothing in common with it or with God. Whatever it had of good, was not for such as them.**

#### v.23
>Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps.

How many are loud in voice, dumb in heart! How many lips are silent, but their love is loud! **For the ears of God are to the heart of man.** As the ears of the body are to the mouth of man, so the heart of man is to the ears of God. Many are heard with closed lips, and many who cry aloud are not heard.
