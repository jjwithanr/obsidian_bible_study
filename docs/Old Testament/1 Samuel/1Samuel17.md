# 1 Samuel 17

## Overview:


#### v.26
>David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"

#### v.28
>When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle."

Man judge even the heart by the outward appearance through assumption.

#### v.37
>The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."

Faithful with little; faithful with much.

#### v.45
>David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.

David knew who's authority and strength he came into battle with.

#### v.47
>All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands."

Godly peace dwells in our hearts when we realize the battles in our hearts is not us to endure by ourselves.

#### v.58
>"Whose son are you, young man?" Saul asked him. David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."

When the world asks whose son we are, we can answer with more confidence than David with "I am a son of God."
