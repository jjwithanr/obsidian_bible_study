# 1 Samuel 13

## Overview:


#### v.14
>But now your kingdom will not endure; the Lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the Lord's command."

It was always God’s intention for Israel to have a king (cf. [Deut 17:14-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deut%2017.14-20)). However, it was to be God’s choice (cf. [Deut 17:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deut%2017.15)). Yet when the time came, Israel wanted a king “like all the other nations” ([1 Sam 8:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Sam%208.5)). Their desire to be like the other nations tainted the entire process. God gave them the king of their choice, and it did NOT turn out well. In contrast, after Saul had disqualified his kingship, Samuel related that God would now pick a king “after his own heart” (i.e., his choice).

This understanding also seems confirmed by Akkadian parallels which use similar language to communicate the choosing of a king. For example, in the East India House Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II, we read, “I, his eldest son, the chosen of his heart…”

Another example is the Babylonian Chronicle which relates to Nebuchadnezzar’s choice of king Zedekiah (not mentioned by name in the Chronicle). After deposing Jehoiachin in 598 BC, the Chronicle reads, “He appointed therein a king of his own heart.”

These Akkadian parallels show us is that it is preferred to take the phrase, “a man after God’s own heart” as a reference to God’s choice of kingship. In other words, David was God’s choice for king. This means the phrase a man after God’s own heart does not relate to moral quality of David in and of itself.
