# 1 Samuel 12

## Overview:



#### v.19
>The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to the Lord your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king."

#### v.20
>"Do not be afraid," Samuel replied. "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.

Love covers over a multitude of sins and empowers us to serve God wholeheartedly despite our weaknesses. Shame seeks to paralyze but He who also tells how we ought to repent.
#jj 

#### v.21-22
>Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. <sup>22</sup>For the sake of his great name the Lord was pleaesd to make you his own.

We do not turn from useless idols to a utilitarian God. God does do us good and rescue us, but He does not long for our attention or for us to experience His "usefulness." His longing for relationship is in rooted in the primacy of His own glory.
#jj 

#### v.23
>As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.

Prayerlessness is sin.
#jj 

#### v.24
>But be sure to fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.

[Consider Jesus](Hebrews3#v.1)
