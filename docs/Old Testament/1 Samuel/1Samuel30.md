# 1 Samuel 30

## Overview:


#### v.4
>So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.

#### v.6
>David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the Lord his God.

Seek the strength from the Lord amidst bitter spirits rather than self-rationale.
