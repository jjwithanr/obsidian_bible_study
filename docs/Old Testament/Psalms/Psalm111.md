#### v.4
>He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and compassionate

The Lord has ordained the remembrance and proclamation of his redemptive acts—particularly the Exodus, the Conquest, and the revelation at Sinai—in the calendar of Israel. His name is "holy" and "awesome." The Lord has shown himself to be "gracious and compassionate" in his providential care of his people.

#### v.5
>He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.

#### v.7
>The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy.

#### v.10
>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.

The revelation of the Lord's character and his fidelity to the covenant call for a response of wisdom in which God's people will "fear" him, submitting to his rule and following his precepts. The fear of the Lord is "the beginning of wisdom." The wise have "good understanding." Another response is perpetual praise to the Great King.
