# Psalm 15

## Overview:
This entrance-liturgy psalm presents a Royal Decalogue of virtues of those who dwell forever on God’s mountain of eternal blessings (cf. [Ps 132](Psalm132)).[123](Psalm123) Since “none does good” (14:2), God atoned for Israel’s sin on the Day of Atonement ([Lev 23:26–32](Leviticus23#v.26); see [Ps 65:3](Psalm65#v.3))). These virtues that characterize Jesus are imputed to those committed to Christ, and he bestows on them the Holy Spirit to give them re-birth and enablement to obey.
