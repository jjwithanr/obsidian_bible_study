# Psalm 86

## Overview:

#### v.5
>You are forgiving and good, O Lord, abounding in love to all who call to you.

Such a needed truth in a season of discipline and waiting upon the Lord. God is not a harsh taskmaster. 1/19/23
#jj 

#### v.11
>Teach me your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear your name

By praying, "Unite my heart," David was saying, "Lord give me an undivided heart, a single focus that sees only You as the sovereign power to be feared and worshipped." In my experience, I have found that the Lord will test us to see if we truly own this reality. He will allow a great storm descend upon our lives for a strategic purpose. Our natural reflex will be to find a source of immediate relief. We tend to explore all our options. Is it possible, though, that this storm has come to guide you into a higher dimension of kingdom living? Oh, I hope you can learn the secret: ===When the storm hits, run into the secret place, establish your spirit, and say to Him with unwavering resolve, "You alone are my expectation."===
