# Psalm 119

## Overview:


#### v.9-11
>How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. <sup>10</sup>I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands. <sup>11</sup>I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.

### GIMEL ג

The _Gîmel_ stanza unpacks in its two strophes the petition “be good to your servant that I may live and keep your word” (119:17, the key verse). At the heart of the first strophe (119:17–20) are petitions to comprehend the Law, the necessary condition to obey it. At the heart of the second strophe (119:21–24) is a petition to take away from the psalmist (119:22) his maltreatment by apostate princes (119:22–23).

#### v.17
>Do good to your servant, and I will live; I will obey your word.

#### v.18
>Open my eyes that I may see wonderful things in your law.

[[Luke8]]

#### v.19
>I am a stranger on earth; do not hide your commands from me.

#### v.20
>My soul is consumed with longing for your laws at all times.

#### v.21-22
>You rebuke the arrogant, who are cursed and who stray from your commands. <sup>22</sup>Remove from me scorn and contempt, for I keep your statutes.

God's blessing rests on those who submit themselves to the law of God, whereas his curse comes on all those who "stray" deliberately from it. The "arrogant" despise God and godliness with their "scorn and contempt."

#### v.23-24
>Though rulers sit together and slander me, your servant will meditate on your decrees. <sup>24</sup>Your statutes are my delight; they are my counselors.

In spite of opposition from the community and her "rulers," the psalmist receives joy and guidance from God's "statues" (*edoth*) as his "counselors."
#vangemeren 

#### v.27
>Let me understand the teaching of your precepts; then I will meditate on your wonders.

#### v.28
>My soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to your word.

The word of God also keeps one from the ways of the world, as it renews an inner, burning desire to live a life of devotion to God.

#### v.32
>I shall run the way of Your commandments, For You will **enlarge my heart.**
#nasb

The Lord has given him a sense of freedom from anxiety and care.
#vangemeren 

Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart   
with boundless charity divine,   
so shall I all my strength exert,   
and love them with a zeal like thine,   
and lead them to thy open side,   
the sheep for whom the Shepherd died.

#### v.34
>Give me understanding, and I will keep your law and obey it with all my heart.

Give me right views of it, of its nature and obligation. It is not a prayer that God would give him the faculty of understanding or intelligence; but that he would enable him to take just views of the law. The word is the same as in [Psalm 119:27](Psalm119.md#v.27), rendered there, "Make me to understand."
#barnes 

The understanding operates upon the affections; it convinces the heart of the beauty of the law, so that the soul loves it with all its powers; and then it reveals the majesty of the lawgiver, and the whole nature bows before his supreme will.

#### v.50
>My comfort in my suffering is this: Your promises preserves my life.

#### v.71
>It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees.

Let nothing be wasted. Suffering is not God's lack of care but His abundance.

#### v.74
>May those who fear you rejoice when they see me, for I have put my hope in your word.

When a man of God obtains grace for himself he becomes a blessing to others…. There are professors whose presence scatters sadness, and the godly quietly steal out of their company: may this never be the case with us.
#spurgeon 

#### v.75-76
>I know, O Lord, that your laws are righteous, and infiathfulness you have afflicted me. <sup>76</sup>May your unfailing love be my comfort, according to your promise to your servant.

Our prayers are according to the mind of God when they are according to the word of God.
#spurgeon 

The psalmist can say, "I know" that God's laws are "righteous" and faithful, because he has an experiential knowledge of God, of his "unfailing love," and of his "compassion." God's purpose for affliction is to refine the relationship with his children.

#### v.105
>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.

### SAMEKH ס

#### v.113
>I hate double-minded men, but I love your law.

“I hate the double-minded” refers to fickle Israelites, who cannot make up their minds whether to follow the LORD or not ([1Kgs 18:21](1Kings18#v.21); [Matt 12:30](Matthew13#v.30); [Jas 1:8](James1#v.8/); [Rev 3:14–16](Revelation3#v.14)).

#### v.114
>You are my refuge and my shield; I have put my hope in your word.

#### v.115
>Away from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commands of my God!

#### v.116
>Sustain me according to your promise, and I will live; do not let my hopes be dashed.

#### v.117
>Uphold me, and I will be delivered; I will always have regard for your decrees.

#### v.118
>You reject all who stray from your decrees, for their deceitfulness is in vain.

#### v.119
>All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross; therefore I love your statutes.

#### v.120
>My flesh trembles in fear of you; I stand in awe of your laws.

#### v.162
>I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil.

God, I want to rejoice in your promises as much as I do when I find out I get a job, see that I ended with good grades, or any other material success. Why does it have to be different?
#jj 

#### v.165
>Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble.

See [[law#MacLaren on Psalm 119 165 Psalm119 v 165]].

See the notes at [Isaiah 26:3](Isaiah26.md#v.3); compare the notes at [Philippians 4:6-7](Philippians4#v.6-7). They have great calmness of mind. They are not troubled and anxious. They believe and feel that all things are well-ordered by thee, and will be conducted to the best result. They, therefore, calmly leave all with thee. As a matter of fact, the friends of God have peace and calmness in their minds, even amidst the troubles, the disappointments, and the reverses of life. The love of God is the best - the only - way to secure permanent peace in the soul.

The meaning here is, that they would not fall into sin; they would be kept safe; they would be preserved from the power of temptation. The meaning is not, as it would seem to be in our version, that nothing would pain, grieve, or irritate them; but, as above, that as long as they were obedient to the law, and disposed to obey it, they would be safe from the power of temptation.

#### v.173
>May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.

Lord, help me. I have chosen you, yet I stumble so often.
#jj 

#### v.176
>I have strayed like a lost sheep. Seek your servant for I have not forgotten your commands.

Lord, I have strayed in my inclinations of finding comfort in my procrastination through YouTube and social media. I desire to seek you, yet it is so hard to fight through the shame and discouragements in my mind. But Lord, seek me out for I have not forgotten your commands. I trust in your deliverance and your right hand shall sustain me.
