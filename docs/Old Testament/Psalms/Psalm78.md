## Overview:


#### v.4
>We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.

The history of redemption is revelatory.

#### v.6
>so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.

#### v.7
>Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.

#### v.8
>They would not be like their forefathersâ€”a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.

#### v.14
>He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.

#### v.17-18
>But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.

#### v.21-22
>When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, <sup>22</sup>for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.

Pastor Mike referenced this verse to provide to the deception behind one of Satan's temptation to Jesus during his 40 day fast. Satan advised him to turn the stone into bread; Jesus, however, knew that God provided manna out of mercy though the Israelites tested Him. Jesus would not repeat the Israelite's mistake in asking for manna to test God's provision.

#### v.34
>Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.

#### v.37-38
>their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant. <sup>38</sup>Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.

#### v.39
>He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.

#### v.41
>Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.

#### v.65
>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.

#### v.67-68
>Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; <sup>68</sup>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.

The favored position of Judah was further symbolized by the choice of Jerusalem (Mount Zion) as the place for his temple.

>He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens; <sup>71</sup>from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance. <sup>72</sup>And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.
