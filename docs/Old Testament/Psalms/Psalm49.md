# Psalm 49

## Overview:


#### v.14-15
>Like sheep they are destined for the grave, and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions. <sup>15</sup>But God will redeem my life from the grave; he will surely take me to himself.
