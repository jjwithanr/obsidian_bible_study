# Psalm 107

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.

#### v.8
>Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men,

#### v.9
>for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.

#### v.43
>Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love of the Lord.

The conclusion to this psalm transforms the hymn of thanksgiving to a wisdom psalm. The righteous will become "wise" by studying the acts of "the great love of the Lord" in the affairs of humankind.
