He satisfies the desire of every living thing and He will satisfy your desire, dear soul, if you take it to Him. You say, perhaps, that you are very poor. Well, then, cry to Him. He has never failed His creatures yet, and He will not fail you. He hears the young ravens when they cry and He will hear you, a man created in the image of God, when you cry to Him.

#### v.17
>The LORD is righteous in all his ways and loving toward all he has made.

As the omnipresent deity, the Lord is not far from any of us, but there is a peculiar nearness of God to His peopleâ€”a nearness of knowledge, a nearness of affection, a nearness of heart by which He looks upon them as His own special portion, His own peculiar heritage.

#### v.18
>The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.

#### v.19
>He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.

If you fear Him, you need not fear any lack, indeed, you have nothing at all that you need to fear.
