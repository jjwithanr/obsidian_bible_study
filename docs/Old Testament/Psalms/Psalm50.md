>He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies Me; And he who orders _his_ way, I shall show the salvation of God.‚Äù

Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me - That is, he truly honors me; he is a true worshipper; he meets with my approbation. The word here rendered ""offereth"" is the same which is used in [Psalm 50:14](http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm), and means "he that sacrifices:" here meaning, he that presents the sacrifice of praise. So the Septuagint: "the sacrifice of praise glorifies me." So the Vulgate. The idea is, that the worship which God requires is "praise;" it is not the mere external act of homage; it is not the presentation of a bloody sacrifice; it is not the mere bending of the knee; it is not a mere outward form: it is that which proceeds from the heart, and which shows that there is there a spirit of true thankfulness, adoration, and love.

And to him that ordereth his conversation aright - Margin, as in Hebrew, "that disposeth his way." Or, more literally, "To him that "prepares" or "plans" his way;" that is, to him who is attentive to his going; who seeks to walk in the right path; who is anxious to go in the road that leads to a happier world; who is careful that all his conduct shall be in accordance with the rules which God has prescribed.

Will I show the salvation of God - This may mean either, "I, the author of the psalm as a teacher" (compare [Psalm 32:8](https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm)); or, "I" as referring to God - as a promise that "He" would instruct such an one. The latter is the probable meaning, as it is God that has been speaking in the previous verse. The "salvation of God" is the salvation of which God is the author; or, which he alone can give. The "idea" here is, that where there is a true desire to find the way of truth and salvation, God will impart needful instruction. He will not suffer such an one to wander away and be lost. See the notes at [Psalm 25:9](https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-9.htm).

The general ideas in the psalm, therefore, are

(1) that there is to be a solemn judgment of mankind;

(2) that the issues of that judgment will not be determined by the observance of the external forms of religion;

(3) that God will judge people impartially for their sins, though they observe those forms of religion; and

(4) that no worship of God can be acceptable which does not spring from the heart.
