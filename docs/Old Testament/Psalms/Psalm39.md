# Psalm 39

## Overview:
This chapter really spoke to me in the post-grad season where I feel the Lord disciplining me in my sinful habit of indulging in YouTube/media and carelessly saying jokes/things that come to mind. I've been so humbled by the grace Joanna and Paul have shown me after many times I've joked about them. 12/2/2022

#### v.1
>I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked aer in my presence."

In the spirit of passages such as James 3:1–5, David chooses to restrain his speech rather than risk losing control. It can be exceedingly difficult to choose silence, but this is often the best option when dealing with irrational, immoral people (Proverbs 10:19; 17:28; Matthew 7:6; Titus 3:9–11). David's own son, Solomon, would later write about the need for such discernment. Ecclesiastes 3:7 says there is "a time to keep silence, and a time to speak."

In view of his internal and external circumstances, the sacred author has determined not to speak anymore. He has made a personal commitment to control himself. He intends to scrutinize his behavior, especially his speech, to see whether there is any unbecoming action. He has found it difficult to "muzzle" his mouth, but he has come to the ponit where it is necessary. The external circumstances that necessitate his determination are due to the ungodly.

#### v.2
>But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.

The psalmist desires to speak forthrightly about his internal problems but fears that he may be misunderstood or that he may speak irreverently and give occasion to the enemy. For the sake of God, he vows to be silent in his suffering. He becomes intensely aware of his limitations; and in his self-awareness he is vexed with life.

#### v.3
>My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:

In his silence, the psalmist learns more about himself, especially **how difficult it is to control himself.** The metaphors "my heart grew hot" and "the fire burned" express anger. The more he reflects on his situation, the more he becomes exasperated. His whole being is aflame. He has to speak.

#### v.4
>"Show me, O Lord, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life."

Unable to resolve his problem, the psalmist returns to the Lord for instruction. The purpose of knowing life's end is not that he may plan for every day of his life. In the greater awareness of the brevity of life, he hopes that the Lord will guide him in an understanding and acceptance of this brevity.

#### v.5-6
>You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Each man's life is but a breath. <sup>6</sup>Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it.

The psalmist compares his life to a "handbreadth" (about four inches). In his heart he feels that life is like a mile, but in reality it is a brief span of time. Even when a person seems strong and self-assured, from God's perspective he or she is little more than a "breath." Human existence and future are filled with uncertainties; a person is "a mere phantom." People may go about busily and gain status and wealth, but they are mortal and cannot control affairs after death.

#### v.7
>"But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.

The psalmist concludes that nothing in life is important or reliable unless one's hope is secured in God. In searching for the meaning of life, he has come to a renewed commitment to God. He is also more aware of his own shortcomings in the presence of God. More than ever, he realizes his need for God's forgiveness, reconciliation, and healing. His hope is in the Lord, for whose deliverence he waits anxiously. When the Lord vindicates his servant, the foolish scoffers will have no more occasion to rejoice.

#### v.9
>I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.

When he was silent (v.2), the psalmist was deeply disturbed and feared that he might say something disrespectful about or to his God. Now he realizes that **his condition is the Lord's will.** Thus he willingly accepts it from God's hand. He does not understand everything; but at least he knows that a personal God is in charge of his life, not an impersonal force.

#### v.10-11
>Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand. <sup>11</sup>You rebuke and discipline men for their sin; you consume their wealth like a moth—each man is but a breath.

The psalmist is vexed by the discipline of the Lord in his life. Human frailty and God's discipline hedge him in. For the child of God, disappointments, adversity, and fatherly discipline are reminders of God's fatherly concern. While the discipline is like a "scourge," yet the psalmist learns through anguish the meaning and brevity of life. Human beings are not divine.

#### v.13
>Look away from me, that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more."

Do not come to inflict death on me. Preserve me. The idea is this: God seemed to have fixed his eyes on him, and to be pursuing him with the expressions of his displeasure (compare [Job 16:9](https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm)); and the psalmist now prays that he would "turn away his eyes," and leave him.

He prays for the Lord to remove his judgement and to again renew his joy, so that he may have a foretaste of the Lord's covenant presence.
