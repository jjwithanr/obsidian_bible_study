# Psalm 32

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.

#### v.2
>Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.

#### v.3
>When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.

#### v.4
>For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah

#### v.5
>Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD"-- and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah

The three synonyms for sin associated with three synonyms for forgiveness are now associated with three verbs for confession: (1) he "acknowledged" (GK 3359), (2) he "did not cover up" (GK 4059), and (3) he did "confess" (GK 3344).

#### v.6
>Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.

#### v.7
>You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah

#### v.8
>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.

There is a sudden shift from the encouragement of God's protection to the exhortation of wise living (vv.9-11) as the psalmist quotes the Lord, who has promised to instruct his children, give them wisdom, and watch over them. The patten of "three" is resumed in the promise of God to "instruct," "teach," and "counsel."

#### v.9
>Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.

Some animals must be bridled to be useful. God gives the godly freedom on the highway of godliness. They draw near to him out of a personal desire for holiness. Those who do not draw near are like animals that have to be held in check.

#### v.10
>Many are the woes of the wicked, but the LORD's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in him.
