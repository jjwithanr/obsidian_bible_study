# Psalm37

## Overview:


#### v.3
>Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.

Trust in the Lord does not exclude behavior. Our anchored reliance upon God leaves the responsibility of "doing good" for us to fulfill.
#jj 

#### v.4
>Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.

This "delight" (GK 6695) is a more positive reaction than "jealousy," as the wise learn to enjoy all their blessings with contentment.

Make your delight the Lord so he can grant His own desires through you. This is what it means to be used by God.
#jj 

#### v.5-6
>Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this: <sup>6</sup>He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.

Similar to [[Proverbs3#v.5-6]].

#### v.7
>Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do no fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.

Similar to [[Exodus14#v.13]].

#### v.8
>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret—it leads only to evil.

Similar to [[James1#v.20]].

#### v.23-24
>If the Lord delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm; though he stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.

At the time, I had no other opportunity following graduation. God spoke through this verse when I was deciding whether to take the Liferay internship or not. The Holy Spirit encouraged my heart when reading this. It was because of God's pleasure that I could only choose Liferay. He made my steps firm, and even after the internship while job searching He makes my steps firm when I cannot see it.
#jj 

#### v.25-26
>I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread. <sup>26</sup>They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed.

Strictly speaking, David is referring to his own observations, not necessarily an absolute condition of the entire world. We know that famines have struck nations in which both believers and unbelievers have died from starvation. Poverty and destitute circumstances can affect even those who honor God. Certainly, as a general rule, God provides sufficiently for His people (Matthew 6:31–33). Believers should not worry about what they should eat or drink or wear because their heavenly Father is aware of their need and has promised to meet it. That provision is not always according to what we prefer, or what we expect, but it's always according to God's perfect will (Romans 8:28–30).

#### v.30-31
>The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just. <sup>31</sup>The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip.

Always keeping our walk with God in view inevitably keeps our feet in view from stumbling.
#jj 

#### v.34
>Wait for the Lord and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.

Similar to [[Jeremiah6#v.16]].
