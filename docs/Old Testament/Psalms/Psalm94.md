# Psalm 94

## Overview:



#### v.9-11
>Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see? <sup>10</sup>Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge? <sup>11</sup>The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile.

The wicked foolishly establish their little kingdoms on earth, believing that there is no God who will call them to account. They need to know that the Lord knows what is in the hearts of all humans. His hearing and seeing may result in judgement and in deliverance (cf. Ex 2:24-25).

#### v.12-13
>Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law; <sup>13</sup>you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.

#### v.18
>When I said, "My foot is slipping," your love, O Lord, supported me.

#### v.19
>When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul.
  
When my anxious thoughts multiply within me,
Your consolations delight my soul.

#### v.20
>Can a corrupt throne be allied with youâ€”one that brings on misery by its decrees?

It seems as if the reign of corruption, unjust decrees, and oppression of the righteous live side by side with the reign of God. But the psalmist knows that human autonomy can never exist together with God's purpose of establishing his kingdom on earth.

#### v.21
>They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.

A human kingdom is destructive, whereas the kingdom of God is restorative.
