# Psalm 85

## Overview:


#### v.6
>Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?

#### v.8
>I will listen to what God the Lord will say; he promises peace to his people, his saintsâ€”but let them not return to folly.

See also [[Galatians4#v.8-9]].

Whatever he shall say will tend to their peace, their blessedness, their prosperity. He loves his people, and there may be a confident assurance that all he will say will tend to promote their welfare...
Nothing is more common than for a people who have been afflicted with heavy judgments to forget all that they promised to do if those judgments should be withdrawn; or for an individual who has been raised up from a bed of sickness - from the borders of the grave - to forget the solemn resolutions which he formed on what seemed to be a dying bed - perhaps becoming more thoughtless and wicked than he was before, as if to make reprisals for the wrong done him by his Maker, or as if to recover the time that was lost by sickness.

(c) This passage, therefore, is a solemn admonition to all who have been afflicted, and who have been restored, that they return not to their former course of life. To this they should feel themselves exhorted

(1) by their obligations to their benefactor;

(2) by the remembrance of their own solemn vows made in a time of sincerity and honesty, and when they saw things as they really are; and

(3) by the assurance that if they do return to their sin and folly, heavier judgments will come upon them; that the patience of God will be exhausted; and that he will bear with them no longer.

#### v.9
>Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.

All who truly reverence him, and look to him in a proper manner. They may expect his aid; they may be sure that he will soon come to help them. This expresses the confident assurance of the author of the psalm that God would interpose in the troubles of the nation, and would deliver them.
