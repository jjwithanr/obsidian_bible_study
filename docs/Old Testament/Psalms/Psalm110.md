# Psalm 110

## Overview:


#### v.1
>The Lord says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."

#### v.2
>The LORD will extend your mighty scepter from Zion; you will rule in the midst of your enemies.

#### v.3
>In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth.

The secret place was Jesus' "womb of the morning." It was the place where life incubated, where creativity germinated, where inspiration gestated, where power percolated. When Jesus burst forth from this womb of happy holiness, He was revitalized and energized in "the dew of Your youth." He emerged from the secret place feeling young all over again and ready to fulfill the Father's mandate.
