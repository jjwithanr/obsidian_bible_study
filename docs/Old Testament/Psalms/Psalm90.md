# Psalm 90

## Overview:


#### v.11
>Who knows the power of your anger? For your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you.

#### v.12
>Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

Counting our days points us to count our inadequacy in light of death. 
#jj 

#### v.14
>Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.

The only thing that will secure life-long gladness is a heart satisfied with the experience of God’s love.

#### v.17
>May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands.

My work will be perpetual when the work of my hands is God’s work done through me. When you bring your wills into harmony with God’s will, and so all your effort, even about the little things of daily life, is in consonance with His will, and in the line of His purpose, then your work will stand.

And our work will stand if we quietly leave it in His hands. Quietly do it to Him, never mind about results, but look after motives. You cannot influence results, let God look after them; you can influence motives. Be sure that they are right, and if they are, the work will be eternal.
