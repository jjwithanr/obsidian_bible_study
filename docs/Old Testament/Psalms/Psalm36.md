# Psalm 36

## Overview:


#### v.1-2
>An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before his eyes. <sup>2</sup>For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.

The fear of God draws us to deeper revelation of His holiness and the dreadfulnesss of our sin. Self-deception creeps in where there is no fear of God in our lives. We become like those whose lives have no place for God's word in [[1John1#v.10]] since we believe the flattering lie that we are without sin.
#jj 

#### v.7
>How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge in the shadow of your wings.

God's unfailing love is contingent on our socio-economic status since it cannot be bought or earned. Both the rich and poor, high and low cannot pay the cost for such love.
#jj 

#### v.8
>They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.

The *unfailing* attribute of God's love unlocks the revelation of His abundance. It will never run out because it cannot. He may withold it or hide it from the proud, but He is abundant in Himself. Delights do not end in God; they end in our disobedience.
#jj 

#### v.9
>For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.

Watchman Nee used this verse to justify not attaining inward knowledge through self-analysis.
#jj 

#### v.10
>Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.
