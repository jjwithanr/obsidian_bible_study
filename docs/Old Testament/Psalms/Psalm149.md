# Psalm 149

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints.

#### v.2
>Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King.

#### v.3
>Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with tambourine and harp.

#### v.4
>For the LORD takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with salvation.

The ground of praise: divine delight, the Lord’s glad acceptance of his people; salvation, the people’s experience of the ‘opposite of adversity’, divine, human or circumstantial. Humble, downtrodden without resource to deliver themselves.
