The Lord's care extends to all adversities, as he is sovereign over all affairs of life, especially the "life" (lit., "soul"; GK 5883) of his own child. Whatever his children do—whether they arrive at Jerusalem, go on a far journey, or return home—the Lord will "watch" over their affairs, "now and forevermore."
