# Psalm 48

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.

#### v.2
>It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.

#### v.3
>God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.

#### v.4
>When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,

#### v.5
>they saw \[her\] and were astounded; they fled in terror.

#### v.6
>Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.

#### v.7
>You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.

#### v.8
>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever. Selah

The psalmist’s hope for Zion’s eternal protection is fulfilled in Jesus Christ when he inaugurated the new age. He, who indwells his Church, promised, “I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it” ([Matt 16:18](Matthew16#v.18)). The language of Psalm 48, drawn from its age of composition, becomes a metaphor in the new dispensation of the Church’s spiritual protection (cf. [Eph 6:13–18](Ephesians6#v.13)). Christ’s inaugurated kingdom will be consummated in the new earth ([Rev 21–22](Revelation21)).
