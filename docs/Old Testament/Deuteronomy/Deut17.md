#### v.16-17
>The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD has told you, "You are not to go back that way again." <sup>17</sup>He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray.

Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
