# Deuteronomy 8

## Overview:



#### v.3
>He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to taech you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.

One step of God's process in humbling us is causing us to hunger for the right things again.
#jj 

#### v.17-18
> You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.." But *remember* the Lord your God, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your forefathers, as it is today.
