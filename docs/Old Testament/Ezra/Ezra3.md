# Ezra 3

## Overview:


#### v.1
>When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.

#### v.3
>Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening sacrifices.

#### v.5
>After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the LORD.

The renewal of the "freewill offerings" (cf. 1:4; GK 5607) fulfilled the promise of [Jer 33:10-11](Jeremiah33#v.10-11).

>With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD: "He is good; his love to Israel endures forever." And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.

#### v.12
>But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.

#### v.13
>No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.
