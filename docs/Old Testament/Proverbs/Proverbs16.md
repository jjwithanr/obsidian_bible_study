# Proverbs 16

## Overview:



#### v.2
>All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord.

#### v.3
>Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.

#### v.6
>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; **through the fear of the Lord a man avoids evil.**

#### v.7
>When a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him.

Goodness has power to charm and win even enemies to itself.

#### v.9
>In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.

See also [[Psalm37#v.23-24]].

#### v.21
>The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant words promote instruction.

Wise speech builds reputation for competence and enhances influence. It leads to the reputation of being "discerning," and its influence coming from sweet or "pleasant words" is to "promote instruction"â€”namely, the teaching will be well received because it is persuasive.

#### v.23
>A wise man's heart guides his mouth, and his lips promote instruction.

Those who are wise ensure that they say wise things. The first part asserts that the wise heart "guides" the mouth; the second one adds that such a heart increases the reception of what one says (see v.21).

#### v.27-28
>A scoundrel plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire. <sup>28</sup>A perverse man stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates close friends.

Father, help me.
