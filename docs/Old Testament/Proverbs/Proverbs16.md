# Proverbs 16

## Overview:



#### v.2
>All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord.

#### v.3
>Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.

#### v.6
>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; **through the fear of the Lord a man avoids evil.**

#### v.7
>When a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him.

Goodness has power to charm and win even enemies to itself.

This verse speaks against martyr's syndrome where the presence of persecution is what solely qualifies someone being used by God.
#jj 

#### v.9
>In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.

See also [[Psalm37#v.23-24]].

The Bible in general teaches that only those plans that are approved by God will succeed.

#### v.21
>The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant words promote instruction.

Wise speech builds reputation for competence and enhances influence. It leads to the reputation of being "discerning," and its influence coming from sweet or "pleasant words" is to "promote instruction"â€”namely, the teaching will be well received because it is persuasive.

#### v.23
>A wise man's heart guides his mouth, and his lips promote instruction.

Those who are wise ensure that they say wise things. The first part asserts that the wise heart "guides" the mouth; the second one adds that such a heart increases the reception of what one says (see v.21).

#### v.27-28
>A scoundrel plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire. <sup>28</sup>A perverse man stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates close friends.

Father, help me.
#jj 

#### v.32
>Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city.

Patience is preferable to physical power. Normally patience is an attribute of God (see Ex 34:6); here it describes a human being who has his emotions under control.
#allenpross 

Lord, give me grace to be patient like you. At work. At church. With family. With friends. With myself.
#jj 

#### v.33
>The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.
