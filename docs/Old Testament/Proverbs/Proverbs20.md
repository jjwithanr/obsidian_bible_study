# Proverbs 20

## Overview:


#### v.3
>It is to a man's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.

#### v.4
>A sluggard does not plow in season; so at harvest time he looks but finds nothing.

This character is typical of all who want excellence without putting forth the effort.

#### v.5
>The purposes of a man's heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out.

#### v.6
>Many a man claims to have unfailing love, but a faithful man who can find?

#### v.15
>Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel.

#### v.19
>A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid a man who talks too much.

#### v.21
>An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning will not be blessed at the end.

#### v.24
>A man's steps are directed by the Lord. How then can anyone understand his own way?

God's control of our lives is beyond human comprehension. This proverb asks a rhetorical question regarding this topic: since the steps of a mighty person are from the Lordâ€”how, then, can anyone discern or "understand" his way? How can we delude ourselves into thinking that we do not need the Lord when even a strong perosn's activities are divinely prepared? As an example, see Ge 50:20; see also Pr 3:6 for the proper advice in view of this truth.
