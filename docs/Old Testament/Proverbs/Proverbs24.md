# Proverbs 24

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.27
>Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.

Get an estate into good order before erecting a house on it. To "build a house" may, however, be equivalent (compare [Exodus 1:21](Exodus1#v.21); [Deuteronomy 25:9](Deuteronomy25#v.9); [Ruth 4:11](Ruth4#v.11)) to "founding a family;" and the words a warning against a hasty and imprudent marriage. The young man is taught to cultivate his land before he has to bear the burdens of a family. Further, in a spiritual sense, the "field" may be the man's outer common work, the "house" the dwelling-place of his higher life. He must do the former faithfully in order to attain the latter. Neglect in one is fatal to the other. Compare [Luke 16:10-11](Luke16#v.10).

A man should be financially secure before he starts a family. Before entering marriage one should have a well-ordered life. In general we to keep first things first.

#### v.33-34
>A little sheep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest - <sup>34</sup>and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.

Similar to [Proverbs 6:11](Proverbs6#v.11).

The similitude is drawn from the two sources of Eastern terror: the "traveler," i. e., "the thief in the night," coming suddenly to plunder; the "armed man," literally "the man of the shield," the armed robber. **The habit of indolence is more fatally destructive than these marauders.**
