# Proverbs 11

## Overview:


#### v.2
>When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.

#### v.12
>A man who lacks judgement derides his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his tongue.

One should hold one's tongue rather than deride a neighbor. The wise man is a "man of discernment"; the other one "lacks judgement." How one treats a neighbor is significant in Proverbsâ€”one was expected to be a good neighbor.

#### v.24
>One man gives freely, yet gains even more; another witholds unduly, but comes to poverty.

The paradox presented here does not refer to financial investments. Rather, in God's economy generosity often determines prosperity: one must give in order to gain (see Ps 112:9; 2Co 9:6-9).

#### v.30
>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins soul is wise.

The idea of "winning souls" means capturing or laying hold of people with ideas or influence (2Sa 15:6).
