# Proverbs 11

## Overview:


#### v.2
>When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.

#### v.12
>A man who lacks judgement derides his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his tongue.

One should hold one's tongue rather than deride a neighbor. The wise man is a "man of discernment"; the other one "lacks judgement." How one treats a neighbor is significant in Proverbs—one was expected to be a good neighbor.

It is foolish to deride one's neighbor. This comes from the Hebrew term _buwz_, which implies contempt or a sneering form of spite. Snide, derogatory attitudes towards other people cause friction and hard feelings. If a man has good judgment, he will remain silent instead of deriding his neighbor. A flurry of insults never gains peace; refusing to say mean things about a neighbor contributes to a good, peaceful relationship (Proverbs 10:19; 29:20). At minimum, the choice to hold one's tongue gives opportunity to rethink before saying something which cannot be taken back.

#### v.13
>A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret. 

#### v.23
>The desire of the righteous ends only in good, but the hope of the wicked only in wrath.

#### v.24
>One man gives freely, yet gains even more; another witholds unduly, but comes to poverty.

The paradox presented here does not refer to financial investments. Rather, in God's economy generosity often determines prosperity: one must give in order to gain (see Ps 112:9; 2Co 9:6-9).

#### v.27
>He who seeks good finds goodwill, but evil comes to him who searches for it.

Whoever seeks good is seeking divine favor.

#### v.30
>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins soul is wise.

The idea of "winning souls" means capturing or laying hold of people with ideas or influence (2Sa 15:6).

#### v.31
>If the righteous achieve their due on earth, how much more the ungodly and the sinner!
