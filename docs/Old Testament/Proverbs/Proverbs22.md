# Proverbs 22

## Overview:


#### v.3
>A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.

The entrepenurial spirit is not equated with blindness to danger. It simply refuses to take refuge in mediocore comforts and lead lives of quiet desperation. The simple continue on their well-trodden paths of comforts ignorant of the dangers that deceitfully lie behind them.

#### v.4
>Humility and the fear of the Lord bring wealth and honor and life.

#### v.6
>Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.

#### v.7
>The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the leader.

Avoid personal debt so that you are not a servant to someone other than God.
#jj

#### v.9
>A generous man will himself be blessed, for he shares his food with the poor.

8/20/2022 I have purposed in my heart to be a generous man my whole life. When I have little or when I have much, I will be generous because the Lord is generous. Lord, give me wisdom with my finances and open doors for me to be generous. Open my eyes to find ways to share food with the poor.
#jj 

#### v.10
>Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended.

If I were not present, would strife, quarrels, and insults be ended? The fear of the Lord strikes my heart at this searching question. Lord, help me be an edifying member of your church who is quick to forgive and humble myself.
#jj 

#### v.11
>He who loves a pure heart and whose speech is gracious will have the king for his friend.

I know my heart strays from purity when my speech strays from grace-filled words. Lord, help me.
#jj 


#### v.24
>Do not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with one easily angered,

Jesus is called friend of sinners but not friend of hot-tempered men.
#jj 

#### v.29
>Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men.

Lord, I want to be this. Help me to be skillful in my work without idolizing it.
#jj
