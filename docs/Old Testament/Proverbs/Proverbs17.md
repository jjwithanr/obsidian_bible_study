# Proverbs 17

## Overview:


#### v.3
>The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord tests the heart.

Therefore, the formative value of tribulation is sometimes directly proportional to the duration of the crucible.

Spring quarter 2022 at UCI was some of the longest, most grace-filled 10 weeks I have ever experienced in my life.

#### v.9
>He who covers over an offense promotes love, but whoever repeates the matter separates close friends.

I've done this exact thing to Joanna. Repeating times when she's gotten mad at me or other occurences. JJ, get some wisdom. That was sinful. Father, forgive me. I am so undeserving of my friendship with Joanna after all the times I've sinned against her.

#### v.10
>A rebuke impresses a man of discernment more than a hundred lashes a fool.


#### v.16
>Of what use is money in the hand of a fool, since he has no desire to get wisdom?

When I have an income, I will invest a portion in getting wisdom: books, courses, and meeting people different than me. Watchman Nee spent a third of his income on books.

#### v.17
>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

#### v.19
>He who loves a quarrel loves sin; he who builds a high gate invites destruction.

#### v.22
>A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.

#### v.27-28
>A man of knowledge uses words with restraint, and a man of understanding is even-tempered. <sup>28</sup>Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue.

Lord, help me.
