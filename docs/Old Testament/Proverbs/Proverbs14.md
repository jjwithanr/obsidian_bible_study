#### v.6
>The mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.

Those who are serious and discerning acquire wisdom. The contrast is between the "mocker" and the "discerning" person. The former is intellectually arrogant; he lacks any serious interest in knowledge or religion. He pursues wisdom in a superficial way so that he might have the appearance of being wise.

#### v.30
>A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.

It is healthy to find contentment, for envy brings constant turmoil. That is, a healthy spirit is the life of the bodyâ€”it soothes. On the other hand, envy brings pain and problems. The word for "envy" describes passionate zeal, a violent excitement that is never satisfied. The one who is "consumed with envy" has no peace.
