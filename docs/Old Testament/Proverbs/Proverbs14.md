#### v.6
>The mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.

Those who are serious and discerning acquire wisdom. The contrast is between the "mocker" and the "discerning" person. The former is intellectually arrogant; he lacks any serious interest in knowledge or religion. **He pursues wisdom in a superficial way so that he might have the appearance of being wise.**

#### v.8
>The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways, but the folly of fools is deception.

#### v.10
>Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joy.

This proverb forewarns against any forced attempts to express empathy.

#### v.12
>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.

See also [Proverbs 19:20](Proverbs19#v.20).

#### v.15
>A simple man believes anything, but a prudent man gives thought to his steps.

Wisdom prevents gullability. This verse contrasts the simpleton with the prudent, i.e., the youth who is untrained intellectually and morally with the wise one who has the ability to make the critical discriminations.The simpleton believes the word, probably because he hears what he wants to hear. The prudent person, however, discerns every step.

#### v.23
>All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.

People should be more afraid of idle talk than hard work.

#### v.27
>The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death.

#### v.30
>A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.

It is healthy to find contentment, for envy brings constant turmoil. That is, a healthy spirit is the life of the bodyâ€”it soothes. On the other hand, envy brings pain and problems. The word for "envy" describes passionate zeal, a violent excitement that is never satisfied. The one who is "consumed with envy" has no peace.

#### v.31
>He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.
