#### v.15
>All the days of the oppressed are wretched, but the cheerful heart has a continual feast.

Life can be delightful or difficult, depening on one's circumstances and disposition. The contrast is between someone inwardly "oppressed" and a "cheerful" person. The proverb recommends the cheerful frame of mind; the image of the feast signifies enjoyment of life's offerings. This is far better than the evil days (see Ru 1:20-21; Hab 3:17-18).
