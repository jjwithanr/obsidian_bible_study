# Proverbs 15

## Overview:

#### v.2
>The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth of the fool gushes folly.

How wise people are can be determined by what they say: knowledge comes from the wise and folly from the fools. "Commends" means literally "makes good" or "treat in a good or excellent way."

#### v.4
>The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.

#### v.5
>A fool spurns his father's discipline, but whoever heeds correction shows prudence.

ðŸ”¥How well one responds to discipline reveals one's character.

#### v.7
>The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so the hearts of fools.

Wise people will spread knowledge when they speakâ€”their words are profitable.

#### v.8
>The Lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked, but the prayer of the upright pleases him.

The spiritual condition of the worshiper will determine the acceptability of the worship. Sacrifices from wicked people are unacceptable because they are insincere and blasphemous (cf. v.29; 21:3, 27; 28:9, et al.; see also 1Sa 15:22; Ps 40:6-8; Isa 1:10-17). On the other hand, prayer from the righteous pleases God. Sacrifice is an outward ritual and easily performed by the wicked, but prayer is a private and inward act and not usually fabricated by unbelievers.

#### v.14
>The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.

Those who are wise and discerning desire knowledge (cf. v.7). Throughout Proverbs knowledge is linked with righteousness, and ignorance goes with sinfulness. "Feeds on folly" signifies the acquisition of folly.

#### v.15
>All the days of the oppressed are wretched, but the cheerful heart has a continual feast.

Life can be delightful or difficult, depending on one's circumstances and disposition. The contrast is between someone inwardly "oppressed" and a "cheerful" person. The proverb recommends the cheerful frame of mind; the image of the feast signifies enjoyment of life's offerings. This is far better than the evil days (see Ru 1:20-21; Hab 3:17-18).

This verse really marked me in my junior year of college. I remember sharing this as a prayer request to those who asked of me at that timeâ€”such as P. Sam.

#### v.16-17
>Better a little with the fear of the LORD than great wealth with turmoil. <sup>17</sup>Better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred.

These two verses stress that spiritual things are far better than material wealth. The fear of the Lord brings more satisfaction than wealth with discontentment. "Turmoil" is anxiety; the reverential fear of the Lord alleviates such anxiety. Not all wealth has this disadvantage, but when it does, it is undesirable. Second, happy, loving relationships are more desirable than a great meal where there is hatred. All too often wealth replaces love in a family. The ideal is to have a loving family, friends, and great food; but short of that, a humble meal with love is preferable.

#### v.21
>Folly delights a man who lacks judgement, but a man of understanding keeps a straight course.

ðŸ”¥Knowledge is the foundation of character.

#### v.25
>The Lord tears down the proud man's house but he keeps the widow's boundaries intact.

Scripture amply confirms that the Lord champions the cause of the widow, the orphan, the poor, and the needy, who were often the prey of the proud (cf. 1Ki 21; cf. also Pr 16:19; Isa 5:8-10).

#### v.26
>The LORD detests the thoughts of the wicked, but those of the pure are pleasing to him.

See also [[Psalm19#v 14]].

#### v.28
>The heart of the righteous weighs its answers, but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil.

 Those who are wise are cautious in how they answer, in contrast to the wicked who blurt out vicious things. The mind of the righteous "meditates on" or "studies" how to answer. This verses advises one to say less but better things.

#### v.33
>The fear of the LORD teaches a man wisdom,Â and humility comes before honor.
