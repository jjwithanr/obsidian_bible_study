# Proverbs 29

## Overview:

#### v.19
>A servant cannot be corrected by mere words; though he understands, he will not respond.

#### v.20
>Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

#### v25
>Fear of man will become a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.

True security is the result of trusting God and not other humans. Fear of others becomes a snare when it gets to the point of letting others control your lifeâ€”their opinions and attitudes put subtle pressure on you, even hindering you from speakign the truth or doing what is right. Release from such bondage
