# Proverbs 29

## Overview:

#### v.19
>A servant cannot be corrected by mere words; though he understands, he will not respond.

#### v.20
>Do you see a man who speaks in haste? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

#### v.25
>Fear of man will become a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.

True security is the result of trusting God and not other humans. Fear of others becomes a snare when it gets to the point of letting others control your lifeâ€”their opinions and attitudes put subtle pressure on you, even hindering you from speaking the truth or doing what is right. Release from such bondage comes when people put their faith in the Lord alone (see [10:27](Proverbs10#v.27); [12:2](Proverbs12#v.2); [Ac 5:29](Acts5#v.29)).

#### v.26
>Many seek an audience with a ruler, but it is from the Lord that man gets justice.

True justice ultimately comes from God. The great miscalculation is to assume that true justice depends on some ruler and that supplication must be directed first to him
