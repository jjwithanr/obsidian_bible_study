# Proverbs 13

## Overview:

#### v.3
>He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin.

#### v.12
>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.

Heartsickness cries, "Oh God, visit me! Come to me in your power and fulfill your word in my life!"... Heartsickness is the product of unrequited power; lovesickness is the consequence of unrequited love.

#### v.15
>Good understanding wins favor, but the way of the unfaithful is hard.

#### v.20
>He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm.

#### v25.
>The righteous eat to their hearts' content, but the stomach of the wicked goes hungry.

This principle was especially true according to the terms of the old covenant. “Abundance of food indicates a right relationship to the Lord and the community, but a lack of it signifies a failed relationship (cf. [Proverbs 10:3](Proverbs10#v.3); [Deuteronomy 28:48](Deut28#v.48), [57](Deut28#v.57); [Jeremiah 44:18](Jeremiah44#v.18); [Ezekiel 4:17](Ezekiel4#v.17)).” (Waltke)
