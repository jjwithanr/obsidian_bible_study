# Proverbs 13

## Overview:


#### v.12
>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.

Heartsickness cries, "Oh God, visit me! Come to me in your power and fulfill your word in my life!"... Heartsickness is the product of unrequited power; lovesickness is the consequence of unrequited love.
