# Proverbs 5

## Overview:


#### v.8
>Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,

#### v.18
>May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. 

#### v.19
>A loving doe, a graceful deerâ€”may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.

#### v.21
>For a man's ways are in full view of the Lord, and he examines all his paths.

#### v.23
>He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.

In other words, if the young man is not captivated by his wife but becomes captivated with a stranger in sinful acts, then his own iniquities will captivate him; and he will be led to ruin.
