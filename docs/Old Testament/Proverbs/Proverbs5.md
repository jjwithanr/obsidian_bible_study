# Proverbs 5

## Overview:

#### v.3-4
>For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; <sup>4</sup>but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.

#### v.8
>Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,

#### v.18
>May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. 

#### v.19
>A loving doe, a graceful deerâ€”may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.

The husband should "captivated" (GK 8706) by the love of his wife. The word signifies a staggering gait and so here expresses the ecstatic joy of a "captivated" lover. It may even suggest "be intoxicated always with her love."

#### v.21
>For a man's ways are in full view of the Lord, and he examines all his paths.

Anyone who does not reckon on God's omniscience will get entangled in sin.

#### v.22
>The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.

In sum, the lack of discipline and control in the area of sexual gratification is destructive. The one who plays with this kind of sin will become ensnared by it and led off to ruin.

#### v.23
>He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.

In other words, if the young man is not *captivated* by his wife but becomes *captivated* with a stranger in sinful acts, then his own iniquities will *captivate* him; and he will be led to ruin.
