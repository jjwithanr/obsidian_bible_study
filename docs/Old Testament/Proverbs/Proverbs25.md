# Proverbs 25

## Overview:


#### v.2
>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.

This first saying expresses a contrast between God and kings. On the one hand, it is the glorious nature of God to "conceal" things. God's government of the universe and his providence are beyond human understanding—humans cannot fathom the divine intentions. Kings have to investigate everything; then they  must make things open and intelligible to their subjects, especially judicial matters. Kings who rule as God's representatives must also try to represent his will in human affairs—they must inquire after God to reveal his will.

#### v.11
>A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.

The main point is obviously the immense value and memorable beauty of words used skillfully. A balance and beautifully constructed saying, such as a proverb (cf. 8:19; 15:23), has lasting value.

#### v.12
>Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear.

A wise rebuke that is properly received is of lasting value. It is comparable to ornamental jewelry—pleasing and complimentary. The verse presents the ideal combination of the wise teacher and the willing student ("listening ear" means that the disciple is obedient to the rebuke).

#### v.16
>If you find honey, eat just enough—too much of it, and you will vomit.

Anything that is over indulged can become distasteful. Verse 16 teaches that moderation ("just enough") is necessary in the pleasures of life (see 16:24).

#### v.17
>Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house—too much of you, and he will hate you.

Verse 17 advises moderation in visiting others. We should not wear out our welcome with frequent visits. The motivation for the warning is that familiarity breeds contempt.

#### v.18
>Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor.

#### v.20
>Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.

Irresponsible attempts to cheer people up only make matters worse. The first line refers to one who takes away a garment on a cold day, **an action that is inappropriate.** The second simile mentions pouring vinegar on soda. The reference is to sodium carbonate, natural in Egypt (see also Jer 2:22), which is neutralized with vinegar; **this is counterproductive.** ==Thus it is inappropriate and counterproductive to "sing songs" to a "heavy heart." One needs to develop sensitivity to others; songs may only irritate the grief.==

#### v.27
>It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor.

#### v.28
>Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control.
