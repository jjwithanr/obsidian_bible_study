# Proverbs 10

## Overview:
Beginning with ch. 10 there is a notable change in the form of the material. No longer do we find the forecful admonitions to seek wisdom, the lengthy poems, or the developed pictures and personifications. Instad we find what more closely corresponds to the title "Proverbs"—a collection of independent, miscellaneous aphorisms, dealing mostly with the consequences of right or wrong actions on various topics.

#### v.2
>Ill-gotten treasures are of no value, but righteousness delivers from death.

#### v.3
>The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.

The text literally says that he will not leave unsatisfied "the appetite \[lit., soul\] of the righteous," which here includes the inner urge toward success.

#### v.4
>Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.

#### v.11
>The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked.

Make me an encourager.

#### v.12
>Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs.

See also [[1Peter4#v.8]].

#### v.14
>Wise men store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool invites ruin.

The proverb extols the wisdom of silently storing knowledge rather than foolishly talking prematurely (see Jas 3:13-18).

#### v.17
>He who heeds discipline shows the way to life, but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.

#### v.18
>He who conceals his hatred has lying lips, and whoever spreads slander is a fool.

#### v.19
>When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise.

#### v.20
>The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked is of little value.

Choice silver is an important distinction as silver was considered of little value in Solomon's day ([2 Chronicles 9:20](2Chron9#v.20)). The tongue of the righteous stands out in value among the sea of the inflated worth of silver.

#### v.21
>The lips of the righteous nourish many, but fools die for lack of judgment.

Moreover, what the righteous say is edifying—it enhances ("nourishes") common life. "Fools," characterized by a lack of discipline and little wit, ruin their lives and others as well.

#### v.22
>The blessing of the LORD brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it.

#### v.23
>A fool finds pleasure in evil conduct, but a man of understanding delights in wisdom.

#### v.28
>The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing.

This is a contrast of expectations: the righteous will experience the joyful fulfillment of their hopes, but what the wicked hope for will be dashed. The proverb is a general maxim based on God's justice.

#### v.31-32
>The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but a perverse tongue will be cut out. <sup>32</sup>The lips of the righteous know what is fitting, but the mouth of the wicked only what is perverse.
