# Proverbs 18

## Overview:


#### v.2
>A fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions.

#### v.4
>The words of a man's mouth are deep waters, but the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.

#### v.7
>A fool's mouth is his undoing, and his lips are a snare to his soul.

The words of the fool show his folly, but they also work towards **his destruction**. Many a fool has been ruined because of his foolish words.

“It is most remarkable that the apostle Paul, when analyzing man’s depravity, focuses on the little member and all that is linked to it—the throat, the tongue, the lips, and the mouth ([Romans 3:13-14](Romans3#v.13-14)).” (Bridges)

#### v.9
>One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.

[[wealth,work#Maclaren on Colossians 1 29 Colossians1 v 29]].

There are times of entertainment or leisure where perhaps laziness can be excused. There is never an excuse to be lazy or **slothful** in **work**.

#### v.10
>The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.

This running appears to me to imply, that they have nothing to carry. A man who has a load, the heavier the load may be, the more will he be impeded in his flight. But the righteous run, like racers in the games, who have thrown off everything, their sins they leave to mercy, and their righteousness to the moles and bats.

#### v.12
>Before his downfall a man's heart is proud, but humility comes before honor.

There is no wisdom in a self-exaltation. Other vices have some excuse, for men seem to gain by them; avarice, pleasure, lust, have some plea; but the man who is proud sells his soul cheaply. He opens wide the flood-gates of his heart, to let men see how deep is the flood within his soul; then suddenly it floweth out, and all is gone – and all is nothing, for one puff of empty wind, one word of sweet applause – the soul is gone, and not a drop is left...
It is not humility to underrate yourself. Humility is to think of yourself, if you can, as God thinks of you.

#### v.13
>He who answers before listening—that is his folly and his shame.

It is common to give a quick, impulsive answer to questions and problems. We respond without thinking, or without hearing the full story, sometimes more interested in what we hope to say than what the **matter** before us really is.

#### v.15
>The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out.

#### v.18
>Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart.

#### v.19
>An offended brother is more unyielding than a fortified city, and disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.

Good verse to better interpret speaking the truth in love. We should be truthful but do all in our power not to instigate offense so as to lose a brother to offense.

#### v.21
>The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

So those who enjoy talking must bear its fruit, whether good or bad. We should be warned by this proverb, especially if we love to talk.

#### v.22
>He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.

The Septuagint adds "He who casts out a good wife, casts away that which is good: but he that keepeth an adulteress is foolish and ungodly."

This verse raised a conviction against my elevated stance on celibacy. By rejoicing in not wanting to get married (out of cynicism), I was casting out a blessing God intended for my life. Casting out a good wife in the Greek uses ekballo, meaning insistently refusing a good wife welcomes a life of sexual immorality

In Hebrew, the wording of Proverbs 18:22 is strikingly similar to that of [Proverbs 8:35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%208.35): “For those who find me find life and receive favor from the LORD.” _Me_ in this verse refers to [wisdom](https://www.gotquestions.org/wisdom-she-Proverbs.html), suggesting that, after wisdom itself, the **finest of God’s blessings is an excellent wife.** [Proverbs 31:10](Proverbs31#v.10) makes a parallel analogy: “A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies” (cf. [Proverbs 8:11](Proverbs8#v.11)).

#### v.24
>A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

Now I have a question to ask: that question I ask of every man and every woman in this place, and of every child too – Is Jesus Christ your friend? Have you a friend at court – at heaven’s court? Is the Judge of quick and dead your friend? Can you say that you love him, and has he ever revealed himself in the way of love to you? Dear hearer, do not answer that question for thy neighbor; answer it for thyself. Peer or peasant, rich or poor, learned or illiterate, this question is for each of you, therefore, ask it. Is Christ my friend?
