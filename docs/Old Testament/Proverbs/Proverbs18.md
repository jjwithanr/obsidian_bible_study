>One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.

[[wealth,work#Maclaren on Colossians 1 29 Colossians1 v 29]].

#### v.19
>An offended brother is more unyielding than a foritified city, and disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.

#### v.21
>The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit.

So those who enjoy talking must bear its fruit, whether good or bad. We should be warned by this proverb, especially if we love to talk.

#### v.22
>He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.

The Septuagint adds "He who casts out a good wife, casts away that which is good: but he that keepeth an adulteress is foolish and ungodly."

This verse raised a conviction against my elevated stance on celibacy. By rejoicing in not wanting to get married (out of cynicism), I was casting out a blessing God intended for my life. Casting out a good wife in the Greek uses ekballo, meaning insistently refusing a good wife welcomes a life of sexual immorality

In Hebrew, the wording of Proverbs 18:22 is strikingly similar to that of [Proverbs 8:35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%208.35): “For those who find me find life and receive favor from the LORD.” _Me_ in this verse refers to [wisdom](https://www.gotquestions.org/wisdom-she-Proverbs.html), suggesting that, after wisdom itself, the **finest of God’s blessings is an excellent wife.** [Proverbs 31:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%2031.10) makes a parallel analogy: “A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies” (cf. [Proverbs 8:11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%208.11)).
