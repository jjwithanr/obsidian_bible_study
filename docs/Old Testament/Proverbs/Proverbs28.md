# Proverbs 28

## Overview:


#### v.1
>The wicked man flees though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

#### v.2
>When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order.

#### v.5
>Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the Lord understand it fully.

The deep interdependence of morality and intellect. **We have a right judgment in all things in proportion as our hearts seek to know God.**

#### v.8
>He who increases his wealth by exorbitant interest amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor.

Story of Thomas and mechanical keyboard.
#jj 

#### v.9
>If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are detestable.

God will not listen to the prayers of those who will not listen to him.

#### v.11
>A rich man may be wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has discernment sees through him.

Wealth blunts, poverty sharpens, the critical power of intellect.
#barnes 

#### v.14
>How blessed is the man who is always in dread, But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity

In other words, the one who is always apprehensive about sin and its results will be more successful at avoiding it and finding God's blessing.

#### v.20
>A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.

The idea is that the first is faithful to his obligations to God and to other people; but the one who hastens to make riches is at the least doing it without an honest day's work and at the worst dishonestly. In a hurry to acquire wealth, he falls into dishonest schemes and bears the guilt of itâ€”he will not be unpunished.

#### v.23
>He who rebukes a man will in the end gain more favor than he who has a flattering tongue.

In the final analysis rebuke will be better received than flattery. The flattering tongue may be pleasing for the moment, but it will offer no constructive help like the "rebuke" (see also 15:5, 12; 25:12; 27:5-6; 29:5).

This is how I felt after leading JHOP on 11/7/2022. I gave a short message and led the prayer topics. I gave a lot of feedback afterwards. Eagle shared there was lack of communication on my role (which I was ignorant). I did not feel "pleasant" after. I said hard things, but I know it was for their benefit if they would receive it. Lord, I cling to your Word and your promises.
#jj 

#### v.25
>A greedy man stirs up dissension, but he who trusts in the Lord will prosper.

The first one is completely selfish and usually ruthless. His attitudes and actions stir up strife because people do not long tolerate him. He pushes so hard for the things he want that his zeal becomes a hindrance to obtaining them. Conversely, the true believer, who is blessed by God, will be made abundantly prosperous.

#### v.26
>He who trusts in himself is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe.

See also [[Jeremiah6#v.16]].

Security comes from a life of wisdom, not from self-sufficiency. One who trusts in oneself stands in stark contrast to one who follows the wisdom from above that this book has been teaching.

#### v.27
>He who gives to the poor will lack nothing, but he who closes his eyes to them receives many curses.
