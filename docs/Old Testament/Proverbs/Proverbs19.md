# Proverbs 19

## Overview:



#### v.14
>Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the Lord.

A prudent wife, unlike property, is God's special gift. The verse contrasts wealth that can be inherited from a father with a "prudent" wife who is from the Lord. When a marriage turns out well, one should credit God (see also 18:22, 31:10-31).
