# Proverbs 19

## Overview:


#### v.2
>It is not good to have zeal without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way.

Solomon insists that ambition without diligence or knowledge puts a person at risk. Without weighing all the facts of a matter (Proverbs 18:13, 17), an ambitious person may rush into a situation, only to discover severe consequences. Proverbs 14:12 explains, "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death." Wisdom and truth are often compared to a path (Proverbs 4:26; 15:10). Those who fail to watch their steps are inclined to become lost: to "miss their way." Other proverbs note that rash decision-making can lead to failure (Proverbs 21:5; 28:20).  
  
The Bible counters "haste makes waste" decisions by exhorting believers to trust in the Lord for guidance. His wisdom promises clear direction (James 1:5; Proverbs 14:8, 15). Proverbs 3:5–6 states: "Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." The same passage warns against relying on oneself when making decisions. It commands: "Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil" (Proverbs 3:7).

The passage reminds us that we must know the time and the direction for action, or zealous effort will be a futile activity.

#### v.8
>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; he who cherishes understanding prospers.

#### v.11
>A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense.

#### v.14
>Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the Lord.

A prudent wife, unlike property, is God's special gift. The verse contrasts wealth that can be inherited from a father with a "prudent" wife who is from the Lord. When a marriage turns out well, one should credit God (see also 18:22, 31:10-31).
