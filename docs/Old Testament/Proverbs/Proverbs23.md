# Proverbs 23

## Overview:


#### v.4
>Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint.

#### v.9
>Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words.

A "fool" despises wisdom; so it is a waste of time to try to teach him. A fool rejects discipline and instruction, often scorning the teacher who tries to change him.

#### v.17-18
>Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. <sup>18</sup>There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.

The contrast is between right and wrong envy; the one is spiritual exercise, the other a disease. The difficulty is that the sinful world seems more attractive. Thus the motivation provided is that the future belongs to the righteous.

#### v.20-21
>Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, <sup>21</sup>for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags.

Those who associate with "drunkards" and "gluttons" will become poor. These two represent the epitome of the lack of discipline. Excessive eating and drinking are usually symptoms of deeper problems; today, we usually focus more on the drinking because it is a dangerous social problem with far-reaching consequences.

#### v.23
>Buy the truth and do not sell it; get wisdom, discipline and understanding.

Getting truth means acquiring training in the truth, and gaining understanding means developing the perception and practical knowledge of the truth.
