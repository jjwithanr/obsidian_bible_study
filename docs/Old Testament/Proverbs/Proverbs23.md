# Proverbs 23

## Overview:


#### v.4
>Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint.

#### v.9
>Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words.

A "fool" despises wisdom; so it is a waste of time to try to teach him. A fool rejects discipline and instruction, often scorning the teacher who tries to change him.

#### v.17-18
>Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. <sup>18</sup>There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.

The contrast is between right and wrong envy; the one is spiritual exercise, the other a disease. The difficulty is that the sinful world seems more attractive. Thus the motivation provided is that the future belongs to the righteous.
