# Proverbs 21

## Overview:


#### v.2
>All a man's ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.

#### v.3
>To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.

It does not teach that ritual acts of worship are to be avoided; rather, it stresses that religious acts are valueless without righteous living.

#### v.5
>The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.

The text here warns about the danger of hasty shortcuts.

#### v.17
>He who loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and oil will never be rich.

There is nothing wrong with joy or with enjoying the finer things life. The "love" portrayed here must be excessive or uncontrolled, because it brings one to poverty. Perhaps other responsibilites are being neglected or the people are trying to live above their means.

#### v.23
>He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity.

#### v.26
>All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing.

#### v.30-31
>There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD. <sup>31</sup>The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the LORD.
