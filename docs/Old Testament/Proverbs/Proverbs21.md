# Proverbs 21

## Overview:


#### v.2
>All a man's ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.

#### v.3
>To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.

It does not teach that ritual acts of worship are to be avoided; rather, it stresses that religious acts are valueless without righteous living.

#### v.5
>The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.

The text here warns about the danger of hasty shortcuts.

#### v.17
>He who loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and oil will never be rich.

There is nothing wrong with joy or with enjoying the finer things life. The "love" portrayed here must be excessive or uncontrolled, because it brings one to poverty. Perhaps other responsibilites are being neglected or the people are trying to live above their means.

#### v.20
>In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has.

#### v.21
>He who pursues righteousness and love finds life, prosperity, and honor.

Virtue will be rewarded. In fact, the idea may be that virtue has its own rewards. "Righteousness" and "love" (GK 2876) depict the lifestyle of the faithful covenant-believer who is pleasing to God and a blessing to others. Whoever pursues righteousness will be filled with "life, prosperity, and honor" (cf. Mt 5:6; 6:33).

#### v.23
>He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity.

The "calamity" may refer to social and legal difficulties into which careless talk might bring someone (see 13:3; 18:21). Therefore one should say only what is true, helpful, pleasant, and kind and avoid what is false, destructive, painful and damaging to others.

#### v.26
>All day long he craves for more, but the righteous give without sparing.

#### v.30-31
>There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD. <sup>31</sup>The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the LORD.
