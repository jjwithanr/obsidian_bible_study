# Proverbs 4

## Overview:


#### v.7
>Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.

#### v.19
>But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.

Similar to [[Ephesians4#v 18]].

#### v.23
>Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.

The author of Proverbs precedes this verse with another call to attention and obedience. This is important.
