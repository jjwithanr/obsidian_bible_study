# Proverbs 12

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid.

It is as if one distinction between humans and animals is this feature of receiving discipline.

#### v.2
>A good main obtains favor from the Lord, but the Lord condemns a crafty man.

#### v.4
>A wife of noble character is her husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.

#### v.10
>A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.

#### v.11
>He who works his land will have abundant food, but he who chases fantasies lacks judgement.

#### v.14
>From the fruit of his lips a man is filled with good things as surely as the work of his hands rewards him.

Proper speech and diligent work result in good things. If one's conversation is wise, intelligent, and honoring to God, it will result in blessing.

#### v.16
>A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult.

Wisdom overlooks insults. Mature people are able to handle criticism without responding instinctively and irrationally. The wise do not give the enemy that satisfaction. It is not so much that the wise repress anger or feelings but they they are more shrewd in dealing with it.

#### v.18
>Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.

Those who are wise do not cause harm by speaking hastily and inadvisably (see Lev 5:4; Nu 30:7). Such talk is like a piercing swordâ€”it wounds. Conversely, the tongue of the wise brings "healing." Their words heal because they are faithful and true, gentle and kind, and uplifting and encouraging.

#### v.22
>The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in men who are truthful.

Julie Lee is the first person who comes to mind.

#### v.23
>A prudent man keeps his knowledge to himself, but the heart of fools blurts out folly.

The "prudent" (lit., "a shrewd man") restrain themselves from displaying knowledge. The verb "keeps" (or "conceals") does not mean that they never speak; rather, it means they use discretion. Conversely, the intent of "fools" is to call out "folly."

Lord, help me.

#### v.25
>An anxious heart weighs a man down, but a kind word cheers him up.

#### v.26
>A righteous man is cautious in friendship, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.

#### v.27
>The lazy man who does not roast his game, but the diligent man prizes his possessions.

Diligence leads to success. The negative image in the antithetical line is of the lazy person who cannot bring a project to completion. Just as a hunter may never cook what he finds, so the lazy person never completes a project.
