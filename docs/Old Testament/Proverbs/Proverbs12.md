#### v.4
>A wife of noble character is her husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.

#### v.10
>A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.

#### v.16
>A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult.

Wisdom overlooks insults. Mature people are able to handle criticism without responding instinctively and irrationally. The wise do not give the enemy that satisfaction. It is not so much that the wise repress anger or feelings but they they are more shrewd in dealing with it.

#### v.18
>Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.

Those who are wise do not cause harm by speaking hastily and inadvisably (see Lev 5:4; Nu 30:7). Such talk is like a piercing swordâ€”it wounds. Conversely, the tongue of the wise brings "healing." Their words heal because they are faithful and true, gentle and kind, and uplifting and encouraging.

#### v.26
>A righteous man is cautious in frienship, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.
