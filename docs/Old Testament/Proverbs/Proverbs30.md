# Proverbs 30

## Overview:


#### v.2-3
>"I am the most ignorant of men; I do not have a man's understanding. <sup>3</sup>I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.

#### v.4
>Who has gone up to heaven and come down? Who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of his hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his cloak? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and the name of his son? Tell me if you know!

To know a person's "name" is to exhibit power over and closeness to that person. The parallel reference to "son" has been identified as Israel, as a simple poetic parallelism for "his name," and (by Christian interpreters) as a  reference to the Son of God.

#### v.5
>"Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.

Out of this consciousness of the impotence of all man's efforts after the knowledge of God rises the sense of the preciousness of every living word that God has Himself revealed, whether through "the Law and the prophets" or through "wise men and scribes."

#### v.7-9
>"Two things I ask of you, O LORD; do not refuse me before I die: <sup>8</sup>Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. <sup>9</sup>Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.

#### v.17
>"The eye that mocks a father, that scorns obedience to a mother, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures.

Severe punishment awaits those who show disrespect for their parents. The sentence focuses on the "eye" that "mocks" a father and despises obedience to a mother. The eye manifests the inner heart attitudeâ€”so the contemptuous look runs deep.

#### v.21-23
>"Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: <sup>22</sup>a servant who becomes king, a fool who is full of food, <sup>23</sup>an unloved woman who is married, and a maidservant who displaces her mistress.

Certain people who are suddenly elevated in their status in life can be unbearable... This assumes that the elevated status was not accompanied by a change of nature.

#### v.24-28
>"Four things on earth are small, yet they are extremely wise: <sup>25</sup>Ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer; <sup>26</sup>coneys are creatures of little power, yet they make their home in the crags; <sup>27</sup>locusts have no king, yet they advance together in ranks; <sup>28</sup>a lizard can be caught with the hand, yet it is found in kings' palaces.

#### v.29-31
>"There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with stately bearing: <sup>30</sup>a lion, mighty among beasts, who retreats before nothing; <sup>31</sup>a strutting rooster, a he-goat, and a king with his army around him.

Leaders exhibit majestic qualities.

#### v.32-33
>"If you have played the fool and exalted yourself, or if you have planned evil, clap your hand over your mouth! <sup>33</sup>For as churning the milk produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife."

The sage advises those who have "exalted" themselves and "played the fool" and those who have "planned evil" to cease their efforts and control what they say; namely, "clap your hand over your mouth!" (cf. Job 40:4-5). The explanation for this warning is that it only causes strife... So the intent of this concluding advice is to strive for peace and harmony through humility and righteousness.
