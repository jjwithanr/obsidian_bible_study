# Proverbs 27

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day might bring forth.

The verse is not ruling out wise planning for the future, only one's overconfident sense of ability to control the future - no one can presume on God's future. Rather, humility is required; one must live from day to day, grateful for the life one has from God, with the awareness that it may be withdrawn at any time.

#### v.2
>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.

JJ, you are allowed to receive affirmations and encouragements said about you. Just don't let it get to your head or repeat for self-praise.

#### v.7
>He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.

The special instance covers the general law, that indulgence in pleasure of any kind brings on satiety and weariness, but **self-restraint multiplies the sources of enjoyment.**
