# Proverbs 27

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day might bring forth.

The verse is not ruling out wise planning for the future, only one's overconfident sense of ability to control the future - no one can presume on God's future. Rather, humility is required; one must live from day to day, grateful for the life one has from God, with the awareness that it may be withdrawn at any time.

#### v.2
>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.

JJ, you are allowed to receive affirmations and encouragements said about you. Just don't let it get to your head or repeat for self-praise.

#### v.7
>He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.

The special instance covers the general law, that indulgence in pleasure of any kind brings on satiety and weariness, but **self-restraint multiplies the sources of enjoyment.**

#### v.14
>If a man loudly blesses his neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse.

How, when, and why we say is important. On the surface this erse appears to be describing someone who comes in early and loud with a blessing or greeting; such a one is considered a nuisance ("it will be taken as a curse").

#### v.18
>He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.

See also [[Galatians6#v 7-8]].

#### v.22
>Though you grind a fool in a mortar, grinding him like grain with a pestle, you will not remove his folly from him.

Folly cannot be removed by force. The proverbs uses the imagery of grinding grain in a mortar with a pestle, i.e., pulverizing, to discuss physical punishment for the fool. Since folly is his nature, it will not be removed from him.
#allenpross 

Lord, I am uncapable of removing my own folly and sinful habits. Lord, renew my mind and heart so I may obey your commands. Remove my folly from me, Lord.
#jj
