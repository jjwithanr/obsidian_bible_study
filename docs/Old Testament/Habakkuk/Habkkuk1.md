# Habkkuk 1

## Overview:


#### v.2
>How long, O Lord, must I cal for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, "Violence!" but you do not save?

#### v.4
>Therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails. The wicked hem in the righteou so that justice is perverted. 

#### v.5
>"Look at the nations and watch - and be utterly amazed. For I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.

To be "amazed" is a human response to an event that utterly confounds all previous expectations; it runs counter to what the listeners "believe." The destruction of Jerusalem was such an event, creating both a national and theological crisis among God's people.

#### v.12
>O Lord, are you not from everlasting? My God, my Holy One, we will not die. O Lord, you have appointed them to execute judgement; O Rock, you have ordained them to punish.

#### v.13
>Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong. Why then do you tolerate the treacherous? Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?
