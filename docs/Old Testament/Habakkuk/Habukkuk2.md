# Habukkuk 2

## Overview:


#### v.1
>I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint.

#### v.3
>For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.

There is an "appointed time" for the "revelation's" fulfillment, determined by the Lord; and it will not "prove false" or disappoint but "will certainly come." Thus the reader may run with confidence and perseverance the race marked out for him (cf. 1Co 15:58). **The logical outcome of this "revelation" is that one should "wait".**

#### v.4
>"See, he is puffed up; his desires are not upright - but the righteous will live by his faith -

#### v.12
>"Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by crime!

The third "woe" reiterates the indictment of ruthless self-aggrandizement achieved by "bloodshed," applying it to the construction of the Babylonian capital.
