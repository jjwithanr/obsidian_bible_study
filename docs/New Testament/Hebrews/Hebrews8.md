# Hebrews 8

## Overview:
After explaining Jesus' glory as our perfect High Priest, he further characterizes Jesus as the mediator of the new covenant prophesied in Jeremiah 31.

#### v.5
>They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was abpout to build the tabernacle: "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain."

Same as[Exodus 25:4](Exodus25.md#v.40).

#### v.7-8
>For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. <sup>8</sup>But God found fault with the people and said:
  "The timing is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a **new covenant** with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."

See *kainos* in the [Greek](Greek.md#Greek]) section.

There are two ancient Greek words that describe the concept of “new.” *Neos* described newness in regard to _time_. Something may be a copy of something old but if it recently made, it can be called _neos_. The ancient Greek word _kainos_ (the word used here) described something that is not only **new** in reference to time, but is truly **new** in its quality. It isn’t simply a new reproduction of something old.

#### v.10
>This is the covenant **I will make** with the house of Israel
>after that time, declares the Lord
>**I will put** my laws in their minds and *write them down on their hearts*.
>**I will be** their God, and they will be my people.

Same as [Jeremiah 31:31-34](Jeremiah31#v.31-34)

The Lord made it clear that this covenant would originate with God, and not with man. At Sinai under the Old Covenant the key words were _if you_ ([Exodus 19:5](Exodus19#v.5), but in the New Covenant, the key words are **I will**.

The best way to make a man keep a law is to make him love the law-giver.

#### v.12
>For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."

#### v.13
>By calling this covenant "new," he had **made the first one obsolete**; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.

The message was clear to these discouraged Christians from Jewish backgrounds, who thought of going back to a more Jewish faith. They simply _can’t_ go back to an inferior covenant, which was ready to completely **vanish away**.
The **system of sacrifice** under the Law of Moses soon did **vanish away** with the coming [destruction of the Temple](Deuteronomy12#v.13-14) and the Roman destruction of Jerusalem.
