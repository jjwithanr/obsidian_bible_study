# Hebrews 3

## Overview:
The author makes the case that Jesus is greater than Moses - a tense debate that dated back to during Jesus' ministry ([[John6]]). He reminds his audience how unbelief in Moses' generation stripped of their access to God's rest and likewise, urges his audience to encourage one another that their hearts might not be hardened like the ancient Israelites.


#### v.1
>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, **fix your thoughts on Jesus**, the apostle and high priest whom we **confess**.

See [homologia in Bible](Greek.md)
The word “confession” means, “to say the same thing.” **When we confess our sin, we “say the same” about it that God does.** In regard to salvation, all Christians “say the same thing” about their need for salvation and God’s provision in Jesus.

The character and work of the Son of God **are worthy of the profound and prayerful consideration of every man**; and especially every Christian should reflect much on him. Of the friend that we love we think much; but what friend have we like the Lord Jesus?

#### v.7
>So the Holy Spirit says:
	>"Today, if you hear his voice,
	>do no harden your hearts
	>as you did in the rebellion,
	>during the time of testing in the desert"

**Besides, he waits to execute his favourite office of a Comforter, and he cannot comfort an ungodly soul, he cannot comfort those who harden their hearts.** Comfort for unbelievers would be their destruction. As he delights to be the Comforter, and has been sent forth from the Father to act specially in that capacity, that he may comfort the people of God, he watches with longing eyes for broken hearts and contrite spirits, that he may apply the balm of Gilead and heal their wounds.

A willingness to learn is usually the precursor of great attainments in knowledge. A “willingness” to reform, is usually the precursor of reformation. **Get a man “willing” to break off his habits of profaneness or intemperance, and usually all the rest is easy.** The great difficulty in the mind of a sinner is in his will. He is unwilling to hear the voice of God; unwilling that he should reign over him; unwilling now to attend to religion. While this unwillingness lasts he will make no efforts, and he sees, or creates a thousand difficulties in the way of his becoming a Christian. But when that unwillingness is overcome, and he is disposed to engage in the work of religion, difficulties vanish, and the work of salvation becomes easy.

#### v.12
>See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, **unbelieving** heart that turns away from the living God.

“Did I not hear some one say, ‘Ah, sir, I have been _trying to believe_ for years.’ Terrible words! They make the case still worse. Imagine that after I had made a statement, a man should declare that he did not believe me, in fact, he could not believe me though he would like to do so. I should feel aggrieved certainly; but it would make matters worse if he added, ‘In fact I have been for years trying to believe you, and I cannot do it.’ What does he mean by that? What can he mean but that I am so incorrigibly false, and such a confirmed liar, that though he would like to give me some credit, he really cannot do it? **With all the effort he can make in my favour, he finds it quite beyond his power to believe me?** Now, a man who says, ‘I have been trying to believe in God,’ in reality says just that with regard to the Most High.” (Spurgeon)

#### v.13
>But **encoruage one another daily**, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.

See more in  [[encourage#Barnes on Hebrews 3 13 Hebrews3 v 13]].

“You are to watch over your brethren, to exhort one another daily, especially you who are officers of the church, or who are elderly and experienced. **Be upon the watch lest any of your brethren in the church should gradually backslide, or lest any in the congregation should harden into a condition of settled unbelief, and perish in their sin.** He who bids you take heed to yourself, would not have you settle down into a selfish care for yourself alone, lest you should become **like Cain, who even dared to say to the Lord himself, ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’**” (Spurgeon)
#enduringword #spurgeon 

The author's method to "seeing to it that none of us have a sinful, unbelieving heart" is daily exhortation/encouragement. We can never encourage too much - have you spoken an encouragement daily to someone? Often, we justify our refusal to overcome the awkwardness and friction in doing so by questioning whether we even hold the responsibility to encourage someone. Oh, Lord would you save us from ourselves, for we are becoming like Cain before our own eyes.

#### v.19
>So we see that they were not able to enter, **because of their unbelief**.

One might be tempted to think the key to entering rest is _obedience_, especially from Hebrews 3:18: _to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?_ But the disobedience mentioned in Hebrews 3:18 is an outgrowth of the **unbelief** mentioned in Hebrews 3:19. The **unbelief** came first, then the disobedience.

A “lack of confidence in God” is the great source of evil in this world, and will be the cause of wretchedness to all eternity of unnumbered hosts. But surely that was not a small or unimportant thing which strewed the desert with the bones of that whole generation whom God had in so remarkable a manner rescued from Egyptian servitude. And that cannot be a small matter which will cause multitudes to sink down to infinite wretchedness and despair.
