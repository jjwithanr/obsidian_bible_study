# Hebrews 11

## Overview:
Known as the *Hall of Faith*, this chapter outlines great feats accomplished by OT characters. Hebrews brings them to life through the new covenantal lens of faith. He summarizes their greatest achievements and by divine inspiration, infers what motivated and postured them to endure such great afflictions. 


#### v.1
>Now faith is **being sure** of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.

However, the word in the Greek has in it the sense of an action and not just of some thing, a 'substance', and I confess I have personally spent a number of years trying to find a correct word to translate this. But the New Translation of J.N. Darby is especially good in regard to this word: "Faith is the substantiating of things hoped for". That is much better. **It implies the making of them real in experience.**
How do we 'substantiate' something? We are doing so every day. We cannot live in the world without doing so. Do you know the difference between substance and 'substantiating'? **A substance is an object, something before me. 'Substantiating' means that I have a certain power or faculty that makes that substance to be real to me.** Let us take a simple illustration. By means of our senses we can take things of the world of nature and transfer them into our consciousness so that we can appreciate them. Sight and hearing, for example, are two of my faculties which substantiate to me the world of light and sound. We have colours: red, yellow, green, blue, violet; and these colours are real things. But if I shut my eyes, then to me the colour is no longer real; it is simply nothing - to me. It is not only that the colour is there, but I have power to make that colour true to me and to give it reality in my consciousness. That is the meaning of 'substantiating'.

It seems to me, therefore, that the word here has reference to something which **imparts reality in the view of the mind to those things which are not seen**, and which serves to distinguish them from those things which are unreal and illusive. It is what enables us to feel and act as if they were real, or which causes them to exert an influence over us as if we saw them. Faith does this on all other subjects as well as religion. A belief that there is such a place as London or Calcutta, leads us to act as if this were so, if we have occasion to go to either; a belief that money may be made in a certain undertaking, leads people to act as if this were so; a belief in the veracity of another leads us to act as if this were so. As long as the faith continues, whether it be well-founded or not, it gives all the force of reality to what is believed. We feel and act just as if it were so, or as if we saw the object before our eyes. This, I think, is the clear meaning here. We do not see the things of eternity. **[We do not see God](1Peter1#v.8), or heaven, or the angels, or the redeemed in glory, or the crowns of victory, or the harps of praise; but we have faith in them, and this leads us to act as if we saw them.** And this is, undoubtedly, the fact in regard to all who live by faith and who are fairly under its influence.

#### v.6
>And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.

*Believing he rewards those who earnestly seek him is* equally necessary as the belief that he exists. If we could not believe that God would hear and answer our prayers, there could be no encouragement to call upon him. It is not meant here that the desire of the reward is to be the motive for seeking God - for the apostle makes no affirmation on that point; but that it is impossible to make an acceptable approach to him unless we have this belief.

#### v.13
>All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth.

#### v.16
>Instead, they were longing for a better country - a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.

For those courageous enough to believe in God, and to believe in Him as _real_, and heaven and eternal life as _real_, **God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them**.

The Father's heart. He is not ashamed of the fools of this world (*link to 1 Corinthians 1 somewhere...*). While the world laughs, He scoffs at nations and collects them as His own rightful inheritance.

#### v.25
>He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God **rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time**.

Meekness.
See also [2 Timothy 4:10](2Timothy#v.10).

#### v.26
>He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, **because he was looking ahead to his reward**.

Because!
Similar to [Philippians 3:13](Philippians3#v.13) and [Luke 9:62](Luke9.md#v.62).

#### v.27
>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; **he perseveared because he saw him who is invisible**.

Because! How so?

#### v.30
>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days.

Ministers of the gospel often preach where there seems to be as little prospect of beating down the opposition in the human heart by the message which they deliver, as there was of demolishing the walls of Jericho by the blowing of rams’ horns. They blow the gospel trumpet from week to week and month to month, and there seems to be no tendency in the strong citadel of the heart to yield. Perhaps the only apparent result is to excite ridicule and scorn. Yet let them not despair. Let them blow on. Let them still lift up their voice with faith in God, and in due time the walls of the citadel will totter and fall. **God has power over the human heart as he had over Jericho; and in our darkest day of discouragement let us remember that we are never in circumstances indicating less probability of success from any apparent tendency in the means used to accomplish the result, than those were who encompassed this pagan city.** With similar confidence in God we may hope for similar success.

#### v.32-34
>And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephtath, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup>33</sup>who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup>34</sup>quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; **whose weakness was turned to strength**; and who became pwerful in battle and routed foreign armies.

Many of us may never have to brave the fiery stake, nor to bow our necks upon the block, to die as Paul did; but if we have grace enough to be out of weakness made strong, we shall not be left out of the roll of the nobles of faith, and God’s name shall not fail to be glorified in our persons.
