# Hebrews 1

## Overview:



#### v.1-2
>In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, <sup>2</sup>but in these last days **he has spoken to us by his Son**, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.

The Book of Hebrews (for the most part) does not present Jesus speaking of Himself. There is a sense in which the Son does not speak in Hebrews; the Father speaks concerning the Son. The book of Hebrews is God the Father telling us what God the Son is all about. “If men cannot learn about God from the Son, no amount of prophetic voices or actions would convince them.” (Guthrie)

Christ is probably presented here as the ultimate Word of God; ancient Judaism identified God’s Word with his Wisdom (cf. Sirach 24:1, 23; Baruch 3:28–4:1). That God had created all things through Wisdom or his Word was noted in the *Old Testament (e.g., Prov 8:30; Ps 33:6, alluding to Gen 1) and developed further in Judaism. As the fullness of the Word, Christ was superior to the authentic but partial revelation of God in the law.

A newspaper is read; a poem; a novel; a play; a history of battles and sieges; but the New Testament is neglected, and there are thousands even in Christian lands who have not even read through the Sermon on the Mount! Few also listen to the truths which the Redeemer taught when they are proclaimed in the sanctuary. Multitudes never go to the place where the gospel is preached; multitudes when there are engaged in thinking of other things, or are wholly inattentive to the truths which are proclaimed. Such a reception has the Son of God met with in our world! The most wonderful of all events is, that he should have come from heaven to be the teacher of mankind; next to that, the most wonderful event is that, when he has come, people feel no interest in the fact, and refuse to listen to what he says of the unseen and eternal world. **What a man will say about the possibility of making a fortune by some wild speculation will be listened to with the deepest interest; but what the Redeemer says about the “certainty” of heaven and eternal riches there, excites no emotion:** what one from the dead might say about the unseen world would excite the profoundest attention; what he has said who has always dwelt in the unseen world, and who knows all that has occurred there, and all that is yet to occur, awakens no interest, and excites no inquiry. Such is man. The visit, too, of an illustrious stranger - like Lafayette to America - will rouse a nation, and spread enthusiasm everywhere; **the visit of the Son of God to the earth on a great errand of mercy is regarded as an event of no importance, and excites no interest in the great mass of human hearts.**

#### v.3
>The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.

That is, by his powerful word, or command. The phrase “word of his power” is a Hebraism, and means his efficient command. There could not be a more distinct ascription of divinity to the Son of God than this. He upholds or sustains all things - that is, the universe. It is not merely the earth; not only its rocks, mountains, seas, animals and human beings, but it is the universe - all distant worlds. How can he do this who is not God? He does it by his word - his command. What a conception! That one simple command should do all this! So the world was made when God “spake and it was done; he commanded and it stood fast;” [Psalms 33:9](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=ps+33:9&t1=eng_nas&sr=1). So the Lord Jesus commanded the waves and the winds, and they were still [Matthew 8:26-27](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=mt+8:26-27&t1=eng_nas&sr=1); so he spoke to diseases and they departed, and to the dead land they arose; compare [Genesis 1:3](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=ge+1:3&t1=eng_nas&sr=1). I do know how people can “explain away” this ascription of infinite power to the Redeemer. There can be no higher idea of omnipotence than to say that he upholds all things by his word; and assuredly he who can “hold up” this vast universe so that it does not sink into anarchy or into nothing, must be God. The same power Jesus claimed for himself; see [Matthew 28:18](https://www.studylight.org/study-desk.html?q1=mt+28:18&t1=eng_nas&sr=1).

#### v.8-9
> But about the Son he says,
> "Your throne, O god, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.
> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the **oil of joy**.""

Same as [Psalms 45:6-7](Psalms45#v.6-7).
