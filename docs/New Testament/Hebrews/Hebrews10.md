# Hebrews 10

## Overview:
Jesus' perfect sacrifice undermines the Old Covenant system of atonement sacrifices. The Savior's death grants all those who believe a perfect forgiveness of sins and an invitation to sincerely draw near to God without a guilty conscience. Since we have this access, the author encourages his audience live likewise in love for one another and perseveare in God's will over their lives.


#### v.1
>The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming - not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.

Wow. Since the Old Covenant was only a shadow, establishing the New Covenant is a way of God saying, "I want you to be a little closer to heaven." We live in a fallen world and [see but a poor reflection] of the age to come, but his New Covenant flips the paradigm - bringing heaven down to earth rather earth to heaven. 

#### v.4
>because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

#### v.10
>And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

Jesus did away with the Old Covenant by becoming the perfect, blameless sacrifice himself to atone for our sins forever. It is only by His perfect sacrifice we can be made holy. We can't grow in sanctification with a hardened heart to the Gospel; **do not confuse sanctification with gaining approval from a stream of church culture.**

#### v.14
>because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.

It cannot mean that those for whom he died are made at once perfectly holy, for that is not true; but the idea is, that the offering was complete, and did not need to be repeated; and that it was of such a nature as entirely to remove the penalty due to sin, and to lay the foundation for their final and eternal holiness. The offerings made under the Jewish Law were so defective that there was a necessity for repeating them every day; the offering made by the Saviour was so perfect that it needed not to be repeated, and that it secured the complete and final salvation of those who availed themselves of it..**.The doctrine taught in this verse is, that all those who are in any measure sanctified will be perfected forever.** It is not a temporary work which has been begun in their souls, but one which is designed to be carried forward to perfection. In the atonement made by the Redeemer there is the foundation laid for their eternal perfection, and it was with reference to that, that it was offered.

#### v.22
>let us draw near to God with a **sincere heart** in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.

Drawing near to God *with a sincere heart* might also imply for us to draw near without any personal agendas and idolization of self in worship. It's not about us; it wasn't us that granted us this access to worship Him in spirit and truth. Even our guilt in how we ought to be or how we ought to atone for the sins we've committed prior to drawing near to Him must be **cleansed** from our *guilty conscience*.

#### v.23
>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.

The New Covenant is an eternal covenant established by the most perfect High Priest. Because his sacrifice is sufficient, his word is sufficient, and his gift of new life is sufficient, we can hold fast to the hope we profess. He is so faithful that when we are faithless, he is still faithful ([2 Timothy 2:13](2Timothy2#v.11-13)).

#### v.24
>And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.

**Love** here is the ancient Greek word _agape_, filled with significance by the New Testament. “**Love** needs stimulation and society. **Faith** and **hope** can be practiced by a solitary, in a hermit’s cell or on a desert island. But the exercise of **love** is possible only in a community.” (Robinson)

#### v.25
>Let us not give up meeting together, as some are not in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another - and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

We do not meet simply to fulfill some cultural norm or law. No, we refuse to live a life of dictation ([[godliness#Martin Lloyd-Jones notetaker]]). There is a desire in the human heart to *be encouraged* and a desire in God's heart to be the *encourager*. God desires to be desired.

#### v.31
>It is a dreadful thing to fall in the hands of the living God.

God's presence is holy. Anything unholy that attempts to draw near to him ought to be in fear and trembling. We must not undermine the holiness of our God.
#jj

#### v.34
>You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had **better and lasting possessions**.

We must hold fast to an eternal perspective. That our true riches are not rewarded and enjoyed in this present age but in the age to come.
#jj 

#### v.35-36
>So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. <sup>36</sup>**You need to perseveare** so that when you have done the will of God, you will recieve what he has promised.

We hold fast not out of sheer determination and discipline; there is a goal that awaits us if, indeed, we press on.
#jj

“Cast not away your confidence.” But, brethren, there is something more. The apostle says, “You have need of patience, after you have done the will of God.” But why, you will say, is patience so indispensable at this juncture of experience? Doubtless you all know that we are never so subject to impatience as when there is nothing we can do. All the while the farmer is occupied with plowing, harrowing, tilling, drilling, hoeing, and the like, he is too busy to be fretful. **It is when the work is done, and there is nothing more to occupy his hands that the very leisure he has to endure gives occasion to secret qualms and lurking cares.**
