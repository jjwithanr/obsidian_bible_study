# Hebrews 9

## Overview:
By defending his argument that Jesus is, in fact, the usherer and mediator of the new covenant that has been prophesied, the author describes the practices and traditions of the old covenant and how Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient and a more perfect fulfillment of it.


#### v.9
>This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were **not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.**

#### v.14
>How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, **cleanse our consciences** from acts that leads to death, so that we may serve the living God!

Our **conscience** is a wonderful tool from God. But it isn’t perfect. Our conscience can be _seared_ ([1 Timothy 4:2](1Timothy4#v.1-2). Our conscience can be _defiled_ ([Titus 1:15](Titus1#v.15). Our conscience can be _evil_ ([Hebrews 10:22](Hebrews10#v.22).

The idea in this verse is, that it is only the sacrifice made by Christ which can remove the stain of guilt from the soul. It could not be done by the blood of bulls and of goats - for that did not furnish relief to a guilty conscience, but it could be done by the blood of Christ. **The sacrifice which he made for sin was so pure and of such value, that God can consistently pardon the offender and restore him to his favor.** That blood too can give peace - for Christ poured it out in behalf of the guilty. It is not that he took part with the sinner against God; it is not that he endeavors to convince him who has a troubled conscience that he is needlessly alarmed, or that sin is not as bad as it is represented to be, or that it does not expose the soul to danger. Christ never took the part of the sinner against God; he never taught that sin was a small matter, or that it did not expose to danger. He admitted all that is said of its evil. But he provides for giving peace to the guilty conscience by shedding his blood that it may be forgiven, and by revealing a God of mercy who is willing to receive the offender into favor, and to treat him as though he had never sinned. Thus, the troubled conscience may find peace; and thus, though guilty, man may be delivered from the dread of the wrath to come.

Beloved, if our consciences were more fully developed than they are, we should have as great a sense of the frequency of our uncleanness as ever the thoughtful Israelite had of his danger of ceremonial uncleanness. I tell you solemnly that the talk which we have heard lately about perfection in the flesh comes of ignorance of the law and of self. When I have read expressions which seem to claim that the utterers were free from sin in thought and word and deed, I have been sorry for the deluded victims of self-conceit and shuddered at their spirit. The sooner this boasting is purged out of the Church of God the better. God’s true people have the spirit of truth within them, convincing them of sin and not the proud and lying spirit which leads men to say they have no sin. True saints abide in the place of penitence and constant faith in the atoning blood and dare not exalt themselves as the Pharisee who cried, “God, I thank You that I am not as other men are.” “There is not a just man upon earth that does good and sins not” (Ecc 7:20).

#### v.22
>In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.


#### v.27-28
>Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgement, <sup>28</sup>so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those **who are waiting for him**.

See [Titus 2:11-13](Titus2#v.11-13).
