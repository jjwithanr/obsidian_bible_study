# 2 Corinthians 9

## Overview:


#### v.2-4
>For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action. <sup>3</sup>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be. <sup>4</sup>For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident.

#### v.6
>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

#### v.7
>Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
