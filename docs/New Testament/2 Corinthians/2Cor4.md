#### v.4
>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

#### v.5
>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.

#### v.8-9
>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; <sup>9</sup>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.

#### v.10
>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.

#### v.16
>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.

#### v.18
>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
