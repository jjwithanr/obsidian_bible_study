# 2 Corinthians 6

## Overview:


#### v.2
>For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.

#### v.3
>We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.

#### v.14-15
>Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? <sup>15</sup>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?

Rather, this is a prohibition against *forming* close attachments with non-Christians, using an agricultural metaphor about yoking (cf. [Dt 22:10](Deut22#v.10); also [Lev 19:19](Leviticus19#v.19)). Although precisely what constituted a "diverse yoke" for the Corinthians remains unstated, it clearly involved compromise with heathendom, such as contracting mixed marriages (cf. [Dt 7:1-3](Deut7#v.1)), initiating litigation before unbelievers in cases involving believers ([1Co 6:1-8](1Cor6#v.1)), or forming any relationship with unbelievers that would compromise Christian standards or jeopardize consistency of Christian witness. Paul is content to state a general principle that needs specific application under the Spirit's guidance.
