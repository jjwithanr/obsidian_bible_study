# 1 Thessalonians 3

## Overview:
Paul in deepest anxiety for the new-born Thessalonian Church, had sent Timothy back to encourage them under their bitter persecution. Timothy's return with the news of their steadfastness and devotion filled Paul with unbounded joy.

#### v.3
>so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them.

#### v.5
>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.

Similar to [Galatians 4:11](Galatians4#v.11).

#### v.7
>Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.

I have Yewon and Paul written in my Bible next to this verse. The 2020-2021 school year was a year marked with new beginnings and much unexplored territory for Irvine house church - especially with it being held virtually through Zoom. In addition to this obstacle, Yewon and Paul had many of their own personal hardships this year: disappointments, sick family, lost friendships, etc. Yet, they persevered because they were able to see Him who is invisible. This is why I am encouraged by them. They had faith amidst such trials.

#### v.10
>Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.

#### v.12
>May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, **just as ours does for you.**

 Cultivating a community increasing and overflowing for one another begins with the leader whose love increases and overflows for them because of Christ's love overflow in their own heart first.
