# 1 Thessalonians 4

## Overview:
Timothy may have mentioned some cases of moral laxness which prompts Paul to address God's desire for them to be sanctified and kept pure from all sexual immorality. What also is mentioned its their strength in loving one another. Lastly, Paul talks about the rapture.


#### v.3
>It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality;

#### v.7
>For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.

#### v.9
>Now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been **taught by God to love each other.**

What an affirmation. The Thessalonians did not learn to love each other by the world. No, they learned from the greatest lover and the one calls Himself love.

#### v.11
>Make it your ambition to **lead a quiet life**, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you, <sup>12</sup>so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependant on anybody.

“There is a great difference between the Christian duty of putting the interests of others first and the **busybody’s compulsive itch to put other people right**.” (Bruce)

ii. “Paul, however, does not mean that every individual is to mind his own business in such a way that all are to live apart from one another and have no concern for others, but **simply wants to correct the idle triviality** which makes men open disturbers of the peace, when they ought to lead a quiet life at home.” (Clarke)
