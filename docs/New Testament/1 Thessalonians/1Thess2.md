# 1 Thessalonians 2

## Overview:
Paul recalls his previous trip to the Thessalonians and reaffirms his sincerity in ministering to them. Unlike professors of other contemporary religions in their region, he did not teach them for personal gain. Rather, he established a father-to-son relationship with them and greatly desires to see them again.


#### v.3
>For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.

See more in [[motives]].

#### v.4
>On the contrary, we speak as men **approved by God** to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.

Just as Athenians were tested for their fitness before they were allowed to assume public office, so the missionaries were tested before they were commissioned as God’s messengers.

#### v.5
>You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed - God is our witness.

See more in [[motives]].

#### v.8
>We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.

It has been said that people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care. Paul gave both his _care_ and his _knowledge_ to the Thessalonians.

#### v.11-12
>For you know that we dealt with you as a father deals with his own children, <sup>12</sup>**encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God**, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.

#### v.13
>And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.

#### v.16
>in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
