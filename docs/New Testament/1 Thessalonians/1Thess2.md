# 1 Thessalonians 2

## Overview:
Paul recalls his previous trip to the Thessalonians and reaffirms his sincerity in ministering to them. Unlike professors of other contemporary religions in their region, he did not teach them for personal gain. Rather, he established a father-to-son relationship with them and greatly desires to see them again.


#### v.1
>You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.

The word "failure" (GK 3031) suggests "void of content" or "empty," especially since v.2 contrasts their boldness and earnestness in ministry. The opposite of an empty ministry is one in which no obstacle or threat is sufficient to deter the speaker of God's Gospel (v.2).

#### v.3
>For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.

#### v.4
>On the contrary, we speak as men **approved by God** to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.

Just as Athenians were tested for their fitness before they were allowed to assume public office, so the missionaries were tested before they were commissioned as God’s messengers.

The missionaries were so open and honest that an omniscient God had found them worthy "to be entrusted with the gospel" (v.4). To be "approved \[GK 1507\] by God" entails a process of testing, success in completing the tests, and a consequent state of endorsement by God. After calling Paul on the Damascus road, God subjected him to necessary rigors in order to demonstrate his capability for his assigned task. Having thus prepared him, he committed to him the Gospel message to proclaim among the Gentiles.

The scrutiny of a God who is able to sound the depths of every thought (cf. Ro 8:27) is Paul's ultimate court of appeal to prove his absolute sincerity.

#### v.5-6
>You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed - God is our witness. <sup>6</sup>We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you,

In the first of three denials, Paul calls his readers to verify his complete abstinence from any type of "flattery" (GK 3135)—the insidious practice of saying nice things in order to gain influence over others for selfish reasons. Paul wants them to confirm that he was never guilty of this practice.
Second, he denies putting on the kind of mask that "greed" (GK 4432) would wear. The greed of which he was accused includes more than just avarice or love of money. It denotes self-seeking of all types, a quest for anything that brings self-satisfaction. It grows out of complete disinterest in the right of others—an attitude foreign to Paul and his helpers. Only God can verify inner freedom from greed, so Paul calls on God as witness.

Third, Paul disavows the desire for "praise \[GK 1518\] from men" (v.6). The world of Paul's time was filled with wandering philosophers, prophets of other religions, magicians, false prophets, and others seeking not only financial gain, but also the prestige of a good reputation. Divine approval (cf. v.4), not public esteem, was what motivated Paul and his companions.

Lord, keep me from resorting to flattery while conveying your Gospel.

#### v.8
>We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.

It has been said that people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care. Paul gave both his _care_ and his _knowledge_ to the Thessalonians.

#### v.11-12
>For you know that we dealt with you as a father deals with his own children, <sup>12</sup>**encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God**, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.

#### v.13
>And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.

They had heard the word preached by the missionaries, but ultimately it was the word of God that they heard. Here is indication of Paul's consciousness of his own divinely imparted authority (cf. 1Co 14:37). His preaching was not the outgrowth of personal philosophical meanderings, but was deeply rooted in a message given by God himself. What had been delivered to him through others (e.g., 1Co 11:23; 15:1, 3) and from the Lord directly (e.g., 1Th 4:15), he passed on to others. Such traditions were in turn taught to still others. Some teachings were put in written form and became part of the NT canon (cf. 2Ti 2:2; 2Pe 2:15-16).
Once received, this word of God becomes an active power operating continually in the believer's life. When it is at work in believers, there is a change of behavior and constant fruitfulness.

#### v.16
>in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.

#### v.19
>For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
