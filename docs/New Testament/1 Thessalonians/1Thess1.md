Paul's memory of the Thessalonians encourages him since he remembered the testimonies coming from their church and how God encountered and sustained them despite severe sufferring.

#### v.3
>We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.

Their **love** produced **labor**. There are two different ancient Greek words for work: _ergon_ and _kopos_. _Ergon_ “may be pleasant and stimulating,” but _kopos_ “implies toil that is strenuous and sweat-producing.
#hiebert *kopos is used in this verse*


#### v.5
> because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with **power**, with the **Holy Spirit** and with **deep conviction**.

See more in [[preaching#Spurgeon on 1 Thessalonians 1 5 1Thess1 v 5]].

By this we may know our election, if we not only speak of the things of God with out lips, but feel their power in our hearts, mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to heavenly things. Unless the Spirit of God comes with the word of God, it will be to us a dead letter. Thus they entertained it by the power of the Holy Ghost.

The holy life of a preacher goes far to confirm the truth of the religion which he preaches, and is among the most efficacious means of inducing them to embrace the gospel.

#### v.6
>You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.



#### v.8-10
>The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia - your faith in God has become known everywhere. **Therefore we do not need to say anything about it**, <sup>9</sup>for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell **how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God**, <sup>10</sup>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead - Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
