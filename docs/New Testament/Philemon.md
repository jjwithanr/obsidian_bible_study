# Philemon

## Overview:
Unlike his other letters, Paul does not introduce himself to his readers as an apostle for Christ Jesus; rather, he appeals to Philemon as a dear friend. He expresses his love for him and the abundant love he's received. After, he appeals to Philemon to accept his runaway slave, Onesimus, back as if he were accepting Paul back. 

#### v.1
>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,
	To Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,

Paulâ€™s friendship with Philemon is shown by something **significantly missing** in his greeting. Of the 13 letters Paul wrote to churches or individuals, in 9 of them he called himself an **apostle** in the opening verse. In this letter (along with Philippians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians), Paul appealed to his reader more **as a friend** and less an apostle.

#### v.7
>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.

Hospitality was considered a paramount virtue in Greco-Roman antiquity, especially in Judaism. Well-to-do hosts often gathered those one rung below them on the economic ladder, sometimes members of their own religious group, to their home and provided a meal;

"Refresh" is also in [2 Corinthians 7:13](2Cor7#v.13).

#### v.19
>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back - not to mention that you owe me your very self.

Here we see how Paul lays himself out for poor Onesimus, and with all his means pleads his cause with his master, and so sets himself as if he were Onesimus, and had himself done wrong to Philemon. Even as Christ did for us with God the Father, thus also does Paul for Onesimus with Philemon. **We are all his Onesimi, to my thinking.**
