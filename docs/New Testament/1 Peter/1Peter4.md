# 1 Peter 4

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, **arm yourselves also with the same attitude**, because **he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.**

The expression here has a proverbial aspect, and seems to have meant something like this: “when a man is dead, he will sin no more;” referring of course to the present life.

Suffering is the template of the Christian life.  The cross is forever an emblem of God's everlasting love and a call for us to follow his footpaths.
Similar to [Galations 2:20](Galatians2.md#v.20).

🔥The act of **suffering for Christ makes the attractiveness of sin hollow.** The believer has put all his eggs in one basket, that of Christ, and has paid too great a price to turn back now... We may in fact still be sinning because we have not chosen to suffer and thereby have done with sin. Perhaps when come to the point of choice, **we choose compromise and then wonder why we cannot overcome temptation.** **On the other hand, we may still be sinning because [*we have not suffered enough.*](James1#v.2-3)**

#### v.2
>As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.

#### v.7
>The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.

See more in [[self-control#1 Peter 4 7 1Peter4 v 7]].


#### v.8
>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.

**True love to another makes us kind to his imperfections, charitable toward his faults, and often blind even to the existence of faults.** We would not see the imperfections of those whom we love; and **our attachment for what we esteem their real excellencies, makes us insensible to their errors**... The subject on which the apostle is treating is the advantage of love in our conduct toward others, and this he enforces by saying that it will make us kind to their imperfections, and lead us to overlook their faults. It is nowhere taught in the Scriptures that our “charity” to others will be an atonement or expiation for our own offences.

*You can't love someone when you're always focused on the their weaknesses.*
Similar to [James 5:20](James5#v.20) and taken from [Proverbs 10:12](Proverbs10#v.12).

This is how we cultivate [[family]].

#### v.10-11
>Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. <sup>11</sup>If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

No one is bound to go beyond his ability; everyone is required to come up to it. Compare [Mark 14:8](Mark14#v.8); [Luke 17:10](Luke17#v.10).

#### v.14
>If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you

#### v.17
>For it is time for judgement to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?

Schoettgen here aptly quotes a passage from the writings of the Rabbis: “Punishments never come into the world unless the wicked are in it; but they do not begin unless they commence first with the righteous.”

Since I am committed to Christ, the persecution I suffer is a sign that I am part of the household of God. He, as a good father, is purifying his family for our good. It is a sign of belonging. I may not enjoy the experience, but I can rejoice that I am among those facing judgement now, **being purified in preparation for heaven**, rather than among those who will face the full force of divine judgement later.

#### v.19
>So, then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.

Remind themselves of [Isaiah 40](Isaiah40).
