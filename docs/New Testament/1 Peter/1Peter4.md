# 1 Peter 4

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, **arm yourselves also with the same attitude**, because **he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.**

The expression here has a proverbial aspect, and seems to have meant something like this: “when a man is dead, he will sin no more;” referring of course to the present life.

Suffering is the template of the Christian life.  The cross is forever an emblem of God's everlasting love and a call for us to follow his footpaths.
Similar to [Galatians 2:20](Galatians2#v.20).

🔥The act of **suffering for Christ makes the attractiveness of sin hollow.** The believer has put all his eggs in one basket, that of Christ, and has paid too great a price to turn back now... We may in fact still be sinning because we have not chosen to suffer and thereby have done with sin. Perhaps when come to the point of choice, **we choose compromise and then wonder why we cannot overcome temptation.** **On the other hand, we may still be sinning because [*we have not suffered enough.*](James1#v.2-3)**

#### v.2
>As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.

#### v.3
>For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do--living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.

#### v.4
>They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you.

#### v.5
>But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

Christians are supported in their stand against the ungodly life by the truth of the coming judgement. In both OT and NT, God is the Judge. Yet the NT also shows that the Father has given judgement into Jesus' hands ([Jn 5:22-23](John5#v.22-23)). This judgement is near (4:7); it will be universal, for it will embrace all the living and the dead. In it unbelievers will have to given an account of their lives and will not be able to withstand the divine scrutiny (cf. [Ps 1:5-6](Psalm1.md#v.5)).

#### v.6
>For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.

#### v.7
>The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.

#### v.8
>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.

**True love to another makes us kind to his imperfections, charitable toward his faults, and often blind even to the existence of faults.** We would not see the imperfections of those whom we love; and **our attachment for what we esteem their real excellencies, makes us insensible to their errors**... The subject on which the apostle is treating is the advantage of love in our conduct toward others, and this he enforces by saying that it will make us kind to their imperfections, and lead us to overlook their faults. It is nowhere taught in the Scriptures that our “charity” to others will be an atonement or expiation for our own offences.

*You can't love someone when you're always focused on the their weaknesses.*
Similar to [James 5:20](James5#v.19-20) and taken from [Proverbs 10:12](Proverbs10#v.12). This is how we cultivate [[family]].
#jj 

This quotation from [Pr 10:12](Proverbs10#v.12) does not mean that our love covers or atones for our sins. In the proverb the meaning is that love does not "stir up" or broadcast sins. So the major idea is that love suffers in silence and bears all things ([1Co 13:5-7](1Cor13#v.5)). Christians forgive faults in others because they know the forgiving grace of God in their own lives.

#### v.10-11
>Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. <sup>11</sup>If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.

No one is bound to go beyond his ability; everyone is required to come up to it. Compare [Mark 14:8](Mark14#v.8); [Luke 17:10](Luke17#v.10).

#### v.12-13
>Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. <sup>13</sup>But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.

#### v.14
>If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you

#### v.17
>For it is time for judgement to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?

Schoettgen here aptly quotes a passage from the writings of the Rabbis: “Punishments never come into the world unless the wicked are in it; but they do not begin unless they commence first with the righteous.”
#barnes 

Since I am committed to Christ, the persecution I suffer is a sign that I am part of the household of God. He, as a good father, is purifying his family for our good. It is a sign of belonging. I may not enjoy the experience, but I can rejoice that I am among those facing judgement now, **being purified in preparation for heaven**, rather than among those who will face the full force of divine judgement later.

#### v.19
>So, then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.

Remind themselves of [Isaiah 40](Isaiah40).
