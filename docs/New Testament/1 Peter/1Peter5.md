# 1 Peter 5

## Overview:



#### v.2
>Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers - not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;

The reason why we serve God's flock was very important to Peter. See [[motives]].

#### v.3
>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.

Their dominion is not to be that of temporal lordship; it is to be that of love and truth. This command would prohibit all assumption of temporal power by the ministers of religion, and all conferring of titles of nobility on those who are preachers of the gospel. It needs scarcely to be said that it has been very little regarded in the church.

The elder's calling is not a license to force others into obedience. He is called to show people how to obey God. A dictatorial or heavy-handed approach is incompatible with God's will for the church elder.

This verse may justify my tendency to put off people's natural desire to elevate a leader for their position. Such a mindset is, first, falsely humble and, second, detrimental to the leader. The leader ought not to put themselves and or have others put them in such positions to "lord over" others.

#### v.5
>Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."

Also [[Proverbs3#v.34]].

#### v.6
>Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.

Similar to [Proverbs 15:33](Proverbs15#v.33), [Proverbs 18:12](Proverbs18#v.12).

In the OT, God's hand symbolized discipline ([Ex 3:19](Exodus3#v.19); [6:1](Exodus6#v.1); [Job 30:21](Job30#v.21); [Ps 32:4](Psalm32#v.4)) and deliverance ([Dt 9:26](Deut9#v.26); [Eze 20:34](Ezekiel20#v.34)). Both meanings are appropriate in view of the sufferings of the Asian Christians. Once more Peter ties his exhortation to humility to the end times. The "due time" is the time God has set for Christ's appearing. Thus the whole destiny of Christians—whether it is suffering or glory—is God-ordained.

For all that he has urged us to submit to our earthly circumstances, however trying, it is really to God himself that we submit (v.6), in hope of his deliverance. We humble ourselves before him not as before an earthly master, awaiting instructions, but so as to feel the burden of anxiety lifted from our shoulders (v.7).

#### v.7
>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.

Similar to [Psalm 55:22](Psalm55#v.22).

This conception of God's concern for human affliction is one of the peculiar treasures of the Judeo-Christian faith; though Greek philosophy at its highest could formulate a doctrine of God's perfect goodness, it could not even imagine his active concern for humankind. The Incarnation reveals a caring God, and Christ's teaching about his heavenly Father stresses his intimate concern for his children [Mt 10:29-31](Matthew10#v.29).

#### v.8
>Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

See more in [[self-control]].

For all that his readers are consumed with anxiety about their earthly enemies, Peter tells them that the spiritual foe is far more deadly (vv. 8-9). And we feel his pressure upon us not just through our earthly trials, but especially through the temptation not to face those trials with faith.

#### v.9
>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

#### v.10
>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and **steadfast.**

Steadfast is the same Greek word used in the [Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders.](Matthew7) .

For all that we seek stability and strength in this life, Peter reminds us in this closing blessing (vv. 10-11) that these are things which God reserves for the age to come. After the suffering of this age, in which we already trace his grace, he will finally complete us, strengthen us, and set us on a secure foundation.

#### v.11
>To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.\

#### v.12
>With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.

#### v.13
>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.

"Babylon" (v. 13) is almost certainly a reference to Rome, which was increasingly called "Babylon" by both Jews and Christians at this time. Using this term here fits beautifully with Peter's theme. It reminds us of the true (satanic) nature of secular power. Christ, however, has conquered it. But also—and more particularly, at this point—it reminds us of the place of Israel's exile and of the face that we too are aliens and strangers in the world... For though exiles, we are yet God's chose, his elect people, destined for glory.

#### v.14
>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ. 
