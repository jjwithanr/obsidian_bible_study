# 1 Peter 5

## Overview:



#### v.2
>Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers - not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;

The reason why we serve God's flock was very important to Peter. See [[motives]].

#### v.3
>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.

Their dominion is not to be that of temporal lordship; it is to be that of love and truth. This command would prohibit all assumption of temporal power by the ministers of religion, and all conferring of titles of nobility on those who are preachers of the gospel. It needs scarcely to be said that it has been very little regarded in the church.

The elder's calling is not a license to force others into obedience. He is called to show people how to obey God. A dictatorial or heavy-handed approach is incompatible with God's will for the church elder.

This verse may justify my tendency to put off people's natural desire to elevate a leader for their position. Such a mindset is, first, falsely humble and, second, detrimental to the leader. The leader ought not to put themselves and or have others put them in such positions to "lord over" others.

#### v.5
>Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."

Also [[Proverbs3#v.34]].

#### v.6
>Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.

Similar to [Proverbs 15:33](Proverbs15.md#v.33), [Proverbs 18:12](Proverbs18.md#v.12), etc.

#### v.7
>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.

Similar to [Pslams 55:22](Psalm55#v.22).

#### v.8
>Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

See more in [[self-control]].

#### v.9
>Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.

#### v.10
>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and **steadfast.**

Steadfast is the same Greek word used in the [Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders.](Matthew7) .
