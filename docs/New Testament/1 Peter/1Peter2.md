# 1 Peter 2

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Therefore rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.

#### v.2
>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,

Continuous nourishment from the "milk" causes the newborn to "grow up in \[their\] salvation." Salvation is the present possession of Christians as well as their future goal. (cf. [1Pe 1:5](1Peter1#v.4-5), [9](1Peter1#v.9)). After conversion, their lives should be marked by continuous growth (cf. [1Co 3:1-4](1Cor3#v.1); [Heb 5:11-14](Hebrews5#v.11)). This growth comes from the teaching about Christ and God the Father that is at the core of God's Word.

#### v.3
>now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.

The image of "tasting" the Lord goes back to [Ps 34:8](Psalm34.md#v.8): "Taste and see that the Lord is good." Those who have come to taste the graciousness or goodness of the Lord should have a continuing appetite for spiritual food. In [Ps 34](Psalm34.md) the reference is to Yahweh ("LORD"; GK 3378), Israel's God. In his writings, Peter applies the Greek word used to translate this title—i.e., "Lord" (GK 3261)—to Jesus. He thus implies the full deity of Christ.

#### v.6
>For in Scripture it says:
>    "See, I lay a stone in Zion,
>     a chosen and precious cornerstone,
>     and the one who trusts in him
>     will never be put to shame."

Same as [Isaiah 28:16](Isaiah28#v.16). Also mentioned in [Romans 9:33](Romans9#v.33).

#### v.7
>Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone,"

#### v.8
>and, "A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.

What is it that is "destined" (GK 5502)? The unbelief of these people or the stumbling that is the result of the unbelief? More likely the latter. Peter probably means to say that the appointment of God embraces both the setting forth of Christ and his work and the rejection by others. Peter's preaching in [Ac 2:14-40](Acts2) made the same emphasis (cf. esp. [v.23](Acts2#v.23)). Scripture in other places teaches that human disobedience is within the plan of God (cf. [Ro 11:8](Romans11#v.8), [11](Romans11#v.11), [30-32](Romans11#v.30)). Yet it must be recognized that though this is true, one does not become less blameworthy (cf. [Ac 2:23](Acts2#v.23)). It is important to recognize also that human disobedience is not necessarily final or irretrievable. Paul says, "God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all" ([Ro 11:32](Romans11#v.32)).

Here Peter displays the same compatibilist approach that he is depicted as displaying in[ Acts 2:23](Acts2#v.23) and [4:28](Acts4#v.28), where Peter holds to both free will and determinism at the same time. In this verse, Peter uses both an active verb (“disobey”) and a passive verb (“destined for”) in the same sentence! Those who do not believe stumble because they refuse to believe (free will), but at the same time God has destined that they would not believe (determinism).

#### v.9
>But you are chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

#### v.10
>Once you were not a people of God, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

This is a reference to [Hosea 2:23](Hosea2#v.23). Together with [Exodus 19](Exodus19), these two texts declare God’s purpose and desire to create for himself a people. The use of [Hosea 2:23](Hosea2#v.23) reminds us that God’s plans will not be thwarted through Israel’s infidelity and unbelief. God’s mercy and love will overcome human sinfulness and unfaithfulness. Through those who have faith in Christ, God is creating for himself not a collection of saved individuals but a holy and united people to be priests ministering his grace to a lost world.

#### v.11
>Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which **war against your soul**.

Similar to [Galatians 5:17](Galatians5#v.17).

#### v.12
>Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.


#### v.13-14
>Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup>14</sup>or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.

#### v.15
>For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.

#### v.17
>Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the King.

#### v.19
>For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.

The suffering must be unjust in order for what Peter is saying to qualify. He does acknowledge that unjust suffering causes grief, so he is not asking his readers to celebrate or enjoy suffering. Instead, there is space to grieve as Jesus did.
Enduring unjust suffering is commendable only if it is done because one is conscious of God, meaning that one puts up with difficult conditions so that God might achieve his missional purposes. Enduring difficult working conditions in an effort to advance one’s career or make more money doesn’t count.

#### v.20
>But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.

#### v.22
>"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."

Peter has deliberately placed this hymn in the middle of this section, so that it has a central place: Jesus is our example, not just in the way he suffered, but in his obedient submission to the powers of this world.

#### v.23
>When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.

When we are wronged unjustly,
-  We should see to it that we ourselves are guiltless in the matter for which we are reproached or accused. Before we fancy that we are suffering as Christ did, we should be sure that our lives are such as not to deserve reproach. We cannot indeed hope to be as pure in all things as he was; but we may so live that if we are reproached and reviled we may be certain that it is not for any wrong that we have done to others, or that we do not deserve it from our fellow-men.
- When we are reproached and reviled, we should feel that we were called to this by our profession; that it was one of the things which we were taught to expect when we became Christians; that it is what the prophets and apostles endured, and what the Master himself suffered in an eminent degree; and that if we meet with the scorn of the great, the frivolous, the rich, the powerful, it is no more than the Saviour did, and no more than we have been taught to expect will be our portion. It may be well, too, to remember our unworthiness; and to reflect, that though we have done no wrong to the individual who reviles us yet that we are sinners, and that such reproaches may not be a useless admonisher of our being guilty before God. 
- When this occurs, we should calmly and confidently commit our cause to God. Our name, our character, our influence, our reputation, while living and after we are dead, we should leave entirely with him. We should not seek nor desire revenge. We should not call down the wrath of God on our persecutors and slanderers. We should calmly feel that God will give us the measure of reputation which we ought to have in the world, and that he will suffer no ultimate injustice to be done us.

#### v.24
>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.

Similar to [Romans 6:11](Romans6#v.11) and [Galatians 2:20](Galatians2#v.20).

#### v.25
>For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the **Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.**

That there is something very beautiful in the expression “Bishop of souls.” It implies that the soul is the special care of the Saviour; that it is the object of his special interest; and that it is of great value - so great that it is that which mainly deserves regard... **Our care is principally employed in respect to the body; the care of the Redeemer has special reference to the soul.** It follows that the welfare of the soul may be committed to him with confidence. It is the object of his special guardianship, and he will not be unfaithful to the trust reposed in him. **There is nothing more safe than the human soul is when it is committed in faith to the keeping of the Son of God.** Compare [2 Timothy 1:12](2Timothy1#v.12).
