# 2 Timothy 4

## Overview:
Paul continues to warn Timothy of a future time where there will be many false teachers and those who commit apostasy. Again, he encourages him to endure and remind him of the crown those who long for Christ's Second Coming will be rewarded. In his conclusion, Paul updates Timothy on the status of some of his colleagues and the loneliness he himself had to endure. 

#### v.2
>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and **out of season**; correct, rebuke, and encourage - with **great patience** and careful instruction.

He should preach in his **private conversation**, and in the intervals of his public labors, at the side of the sick bed, and wherever there is a prospect of doing good to any one. If his heart is **full of love to the Saviour and to souls, he cannot help doing this.**

#### v.3
>For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctine. Instead, **to suit their own desires**, they will gather around them a great number of *teachers* to say what their **itching ears want to hear**.

For the Greek on *desires* see [the Greek section Bible](Greek.md).

The apostle here says, that by turning away from Timothy, and from sound instruction, they would not abandon all religious teachers, but would **rather increase and multiply them**. A desire to hear the truth, and to learn the way of salvation, is a good desire. But this can be better gratified by far under the patient and intelligent labor of a **single religious teacher**, than by running after many teachers, or than by frequent changes. How much would a child learn if he was **constantly running from one school to another**? The true principle should be, to select those who will **faithfully declare the truth**, and who will** not shrink from exposing and denouncing sin**, wherever it may be found.

Does this mean that at in end times, more *teachers* will arise? An increase in teachers does not gurantee more educated, edified, or sanctified congregations. Rather, it begs a greater obligation to put said teachers under much scrutiny to ensure they are not merely appealing itching ears.

#### v.4
>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.

That is, the people themselves will turn away from the truth. It does not mean that the teachers would turn them away by the influence of their instructions.
#barnes 

Today's epidemic of moral relativism is a prime example of a form of going *away from the truth*. If there is no absolute, standardized, authoratitive truth that we ought to conform to, there is no truth to *turn away from*. It is merely stew boiled from the individual's emotions, thoughts, and experiences.

#### v.5
>But you, be sober in all these things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministries.

Keep thyself from all sin, and from all idleness and laziness, and do this industriously, that thou mayst honour God in thy work.

See endurance in [2 Timothy 2:3](2Timothy2.md#v.3-4)

#### v.10
>for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia.

that he was at first a friend and fellow-laborer of Paul, but that, under the influence of a desire to live, he afterward forsook him, even in circumstances where he greatly needed the presence of a friend.

**Having loved this present world -** This does not mean, necessarily, that he was an avaricious man, or that, in itself, he loved the honors or wealth of this world; but **it means that he desired to live.** He was not willing to stay with Paul, and subject himself to the probabilities of martyrdom; and, in order to secure his life, he departed to a place of safety. The Greek is, ἀγαπὴσας τὸν νὺν αἰῶνα agapēsas ton nun aiōna - having loved the world that now is; that is, this world as it is, with all its cares, and troubles, and comforts; having desired to remain in this world, rather than to go to the other. There is, perhaps, a slight censure here in the language of Paul - “the censure of grief;” but there is no reason why Demas should be held up as an example of a worldly man. **That he desired to live longer; that he was unwilling to remain and risk the loss of life, is indeed clear**. That Paul was pained by his departure, and that he felt lonely and sad, is quite apparent; but I see no evidence that Demas was influenced by what are commonly called worldly feelings, or that he was led to this course by the desire of wealth, or fame, or pleasure.

#### v.16
>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but **everyone deserted me**. May it not be held against them.

Wow. Demas in [[2Timothy4#v.10]]

True friendship, founded on sincere love, so rare, so difficult to be found, so little known among the gay and the great, is one of the richest of Heaven’s blessings to man, and when enjoyed, should be regarded as more than a compensation for all of show, and splendor, and flattery that wealth can obtain.

How we respond in times of betrayal will determine our promotion in the kingdom.
