# 2 Timothy 2

## Overview:
Continuing in counseling Timothy in light of his hardships, Paul compares service to God to the endurance of a soldier, discipline of an athlete, and patience of a farmer. Then he places the object to which we are to endure for - the elect. He advises Timothy to keep teaching the gospel and avoid false teachings or useless conversations. Lastly, he points to his character and advises to flee certain vices and pursue the virtues of righteousness, faith, love and peace.


#### v.1
>You then, my son, **be strong in the grace** that is in Christ Jesus.

The meaning is, Be strong, relying on the grace which the Lord Jesus only can impart. #barnes 

What an irony. We are called to be strong *in the grace that is in Christ Jesus*. We are to be confident His grace gives us the strength to endure trials of various kinds.

#### v.3-4
>Endure hardhsip with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one serving a soldier gets involved in civilian affiars - he wants to please his commanding officer.

Soldiers were not even allowed to marry during their term of service and were to be strictly **devoted to their service for over twenty years**; only about half survived to retire.

#### v.6
>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.

The point was not that the husbandman would be the first one who would partake of the fruits; but that **he must first labor before he obtained the reward.** Thus understood, this would be an encouragement to Timothy to persevere in his toils, looking onward to the reward.

#### v.10
>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.

The elect are the Jews.
#jj 

#### v.11-13
>Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him; <sup>12</sup>if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us; <sup>13</sup>if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.

Although God's character is **immutable**, his dealings with people depend on their response to him. The faithfulness of God to his covenant is not suspended by the breach of that covenant by the unfaithful; but those individuals who break his covenant are not saved.
#craigkeener see also [Psalm 18:25-26](Psalm18#v.25-26)

The meaning must be, that **if we are unbelieving and unfaithful, Christ will remain true to his word, and we cannot hope to be saved.** The object of the apostle evidently is, to **excite Timothy to fidelity in the performance of duty, and to encourage him to bear trials, by the assurance that we cannot hope to escape if we are not faithful to the cause of the Saviour.** This interpretation accords with the design which he had in view.
Verse 13b implying that it would be a denial of his very nature to save those who are unfaithful. He is holy; and how can he save one who is unholy? His very nature is purity; and how can he save one who has no purity?
#barnes 

We cannot pick and choose what aspect of God's character we accept. We must therefore consider both his sternness in verse 12 and promise in verse 11 according to our endurance and faithfulness to him [Romans 11:22](Romans11#v.22).

#### v.14
>Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and ruins those who listen.

Also in [1 Timothy 1:6-7](1Timothy1#v.7) and [1 Timothy 6:4](1Timothy6#v.4).


#### v.16
>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.

#### v.18
>who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.

#### v.21
>If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.

#### v.22
>Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

Boy, can you be alone?

#### v.24
>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.

#### v.25-26
>Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, <sup>26</sup>an that they will come to their sense and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
