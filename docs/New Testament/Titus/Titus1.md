# Titus 1

## Overview:
Paul starts and finishes this chapter with a clear plumbline of the conduct of a true minister of Christ's gospel. His first command to Titus is for him to appoint qualified elders in every town. This is likely in response to the influx of many false teachers. Thus, Paul's second command is for Titus to rebuke all them so they can have sound doctrine.


#### v.1-3
>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness - <sup>2</sup>a **faith** and **knowledge** resting on the **hope of eternal life**, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time, <sup>3</sup>and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,

All gospel truth is according to godliness, teaching the fear of God. The intent of the gospel is to **raise up hope as well as faith**; to take off the mind and heart from the world, and to raise them to heaven and the things above. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter of Divine promise so early, and what thanks are due for our privileges! Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and whoso is appointed and called, must preach the word. Grace is the free favour of God, and acceptance with him.

Jewish sources traditionally employed the phrase “*eternal life” to mean the **“life of the world to come,”** which (according to Jewish teaching) was to be inaugurated by the future *resurrection of the dead. That God could not lie, that he had spoken through the prophets from the beginning and that the future resurrection could be proved from the earliest parts of the Bible fit common Jewish teaching and could not be disputed by his opponents (1:10).

What is faith and knowledge from God except that it is rested upon a hope for eternity? What good to have faith or knowledge if it not for the most prized reward - eternal pleasure and initmacy with the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The truth that turns dead sinners into lively saints is rooted in a reality where we spend eternity fellowshipping with God.




#### v.6-8
>An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the chargeof being wild and disobeident. <sup>7</sup>Since an overseer is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless - not overbearing, **not quick-tempered**, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. <sup>8</sup>Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, **who is self-controlled**, upright, holy and disciplined.

The ancient Greek word used here (_orgilos_) actually refers more to _a settled state of anger_ than the flash of an occasional bad temper. It speaks of a man who has a constant simmering anger and who nourishes his anger against others – close to the idea of a **_bitter_ man.**

#### v.9
>He must **hold firmly** to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can **encourage others** by sound doctrine and **refute** those who oppose it.

from Greek section in [[Greek]]: "holds on to" in a way that matches the object grasped.
Elders must hold onto (*devoted* in [Luke 16:13](Luke16#v.13)) the word as tightly as the word is holding on to him after he heard it taught.

To persuade them, or to bring them over to your views by kind exhortation, and by the instruction which shall convince. The former method is to be used **where men know the truth, but need encouragement to follow it**; the latter, **where they are ignorant, or are opposed to it**. Both exhortation and argument are to be used by the ministers of religion.

#### v.12-13
>Even one of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons." <sup>13</sup>This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith

“So notorious were the Cretans that the Greeks actually formed a verb _kretizein_, _to cretize_, which means _to lie and to cheat_; and they had a proverbial phrase, _kreitzein pros Kreta_, to cretize against a Cretan, which meant to _match lies with lies_, as diamond cuts diamond.” (Barclay)
Paul didn’t say to Titus, “Cretans are liars and cheats and gluttons, with one of the worst reputations of any group in the Roman Empire. You should look for an easier group to work with.” Instead he said, “I know how bad they are. Go out and change them with the power of Jesus and for His glory.”

#### v.15
>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.

"Paul was refuting the false teaching of these legalists with reference to *foods*. They were teaching that Jewish dietary laws still applied to Christian believers." (Wiersbe)
"The *all things* refers to everything which is non-moral; such as appetite and food, desire and marriage, exchange and commerce, weariness and recreation, and so on through all the varied realm of life. To the pure all these things are pure, and they will be maintained in purity. To the impure, every one of them may be made the vehicle and occasion of impurity." (Morgan)

#### v.16
>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are **detestable**, disobeident and **unfit** for doing anything good.

The word **abominable** has the idea of _polluted by idolatry_.
**Disqualified**: The ancient Greek word is _adokimos_, and was used in many different ways:

- It was used to describe a counterfeit coin.
- It was used to describe a cowardly soldier who failed in battle.
- It was used of a candidate rejected for elected office.
- It was used of stone rejected by builders. If a stone had a bad enough flaw, it was marked with a capital A (for _adokimos_) and set aside as unfit.

Yet is this character confined to them? Are there none now who profess that they know God, but in works deny him; whose conduct is such that it ought to be abhorred; who are disobedient to the plain commands of God, and whose character in respect to all that pertains to true piety is to be disapproved by the truly pious, and will be by God at the last day? Alas, taking the church at large, there are many such, and the fact that there are such persons is the grand hindrance to the triumphs of religion on the earth. **“The way to heaven is blocked up by dead professors of religion.”**
#barnes 

In the Old Testament, “knowing God” was being in covenant relationship with him; on a personal level, this meant an intimate relationship of faithfulness to him. But the claim was false if not accompanied by just treatment of others and obedience to the Scriptures (Hos 8:2-3; Jer 22:16).
