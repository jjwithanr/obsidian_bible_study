#### v.16
>I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation for everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.

#### v.18
>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,

All forms of wickedness comes from our attempt to suppress the truth.

#### v.24
>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.

This does not mean that God caused us to sin, but rather, that he deliberately withheld His help and allowed us to sink into deeper deprivation. But this giving over of humanity to sin was not, thankfully, God's last word on the subject because it is very significant the same verb is used, "to give over," in 8:32 to describe the giving over of God's son, our salvation. The curse was lifted when Christ himself was given over, on our behalf, to receive punishment for the very sins listed in these verses. God allows us to go our own way in order that we might at last learn from our consequent wretchedness the hate of futility of a life turned away from the truth of God.

#### v.31
>they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
