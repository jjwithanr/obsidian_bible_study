# Romans 8

## Overview:


#### v.26
>In the same way, the Spirit helps in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.

#### v.27
>and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to _the will of_ God.

(1) The Spirit is given according to his will. It is his gracious purpose to grant his aid to all who truly love him.
(2) **the desires which he excites in the heart of the Christian are those which are according to his will;** they are such as God wishes to exist; the contrite, humble, and penitent pleading of sinners for mercy.
(3) he superintends and guards Christians in their prayers.
