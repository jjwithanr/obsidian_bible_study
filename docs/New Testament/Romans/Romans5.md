# Romans 5

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

#### v.8
>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

#### v.15
>But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
