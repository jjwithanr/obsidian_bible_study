# Romans 12

## Overview:


#### v.1-2
>Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship. <sup>2</sup>Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve of what God's will is—his good, pleasing, and perfect will.

"Therefore" establishes a connection with the entire foregoing presentation in this letter. It particularly relates to [6:13](Romans6#v.13), [19](Romans6#v.19), as a comparison of the terminology will show... Since the milieu of thought is so similar to ch. 6, it is natural to conclude that "bodies" (GK 5393) here include both the person (the volition of the one making the dedication) and the bodily powers that are thus set apart for God's use. In Greek thought the body was considered the receptacle containing the soul, but this was not the Hebraic concept, which viewed the human being as a unit. Thus Paul is not urging the dedication of the body as an entity distinct from the inner self; rather, he views the body as the vehicle that implements the desires and choices of the redeemed spirit. Through the body we serve God.
