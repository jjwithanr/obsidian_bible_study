# Romans 6

## Overview:


#### v.6-7
>For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—<sup>7</sup>because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.

#### v.11-12
>In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. <sup>12</sup>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.

Because we are dead to sin through our union with Christ, we are not to let sin reign in our mortal bodies. Our daily experience with regard to sin is determined—not by our reckoning, but by our will—by whether we allow sin to reign in our bodies. But our will must be influenced by the fact that we died to sin.

Before our salvation, before our death to the reign of sin, such an exhortation would have been futile. You cannot say to a slave, "Live as a free man," but you can say that to someone delivered from slavery. Now that we are in fact dead to sin—to its rule and reign—we are to count on that being true. We are to keep before us this fact that we are no longer slaves. We can now stand up to sin and say no to it. Before we had no choice; now we have one. When we sin as Christians, we do not sin as slaves, but as individuals with the freedom of choice. **We sin because we choose to sin.**

==To confuse the potential for resisting (which God provided) with the responsibility for resisting (which is ours) is to court disaster in our pursuit of holiness. ==

#### v.23
>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
