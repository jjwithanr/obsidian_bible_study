# Romans 11

## Overview:


#### v.1-2
>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. <sup>2</sup>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:

#### v.8
>as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day."

#### v.11
>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.

#### v.22
>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.

#### v.29
>for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.

#### v.25
>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.


#### v.30
>Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,

#### v.31
>so that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.

#### v.32
>For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
