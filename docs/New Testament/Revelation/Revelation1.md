# Revelation 1

## Overview:



#### v.1
>**The revelation of Jesus Christ,** which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,

The great fault of many professors is that Christ is to them a character upon paper; certainly more than a myth, but yet a person of the dim past, an historical personage who lived many years ago, and did most admirable deeds, by the which we are saved, but who is far from being a living, present, bright reality.

#### v.3
>Blessed is the one who reads the words of his prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.

Because they neglect the book Revelation, many people miss this blessing. For example, the Anglican Church virtually omits Revelation in its regular schedule of readings for both public worship and private devotions. This is a typical attitude towards the Book of Revelation. Many people believe that only fanatics want to dig deep into this book, but really, it is a book for anyone who wants to be **blessed**.

#### v.5-6
>and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
>To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, <sup>6</sup>and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father - to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.

Similar to [1 Peter 2:9](1Peter2#v.9).

Notice the order: first **loved**, then **washed**. It wasn’t that God washed us out of some sense of duty and then loved us because we were then clean. He **loved us** while we were dirty, but then He **washed us**.

This refers undoubtedly to the Lord Jesus, whose love for people was so strong that nothing more was necessary to characterize him than to speak of him as the one “who loved us.” It is manifest that the division in the verses should have been made here, for this commences a new subject, not having any special connection with what precedes. In Revelation 1:4, and the first part of this verse, the writer had invoked grace from the Father, the Spirit, and the Saviour. In the latter clause of the verse there commences an ascription of praise to the Redeemer; an ascription to him particularly, because the whole book is regarded as a revelation from him Revelation 1:1; because he was the one who especially appeared to John in the visions of Patmos; and because he was to be the great agent in carrying into execution the purposes revealed in this book.

#### v.12
>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,

“A lamp is not _light in itself_, it is only the _instrument_ of dispensing light, and it must receive both _oil_ and _fire_ before it can dispense any; so no Church has in itself either _grace_ or _glory_, it must receive all from Christ its head, else it can dispense neither light nor life.” (Clarke)

#### v.16
>In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.

Similar to [Hebrews 1:3](Hebrews1#v.3).

#### v.17
>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last."

It matters not what aileth us if we lie at Jesus’ feet. Better be dead there than alive anywhere else.🔥

“It is I; be not afraid.” The fact that it was the Saviour, though he appeared in this form of overpowering majesty, was a reason why John should not be afraid. Why that was a reason, he immediately adds - that he was the first and the last; that though he had been dead he was now alive, and would continue ever to live, and that he had the keys of hell and of death. It is evident that John was overpowered with that awful emotion which the human mind must feel at the evidence of the presence of God. Thus, people feel when God seems to come near them by the impressive symbols of his majesty - as in the thunder, the earthquake, and the tempest. Compare [Habakkuk 3:16](Habakkuk3.md#v.16); [Luke 9:34](Luke9#v.34). Yet, amidst the most awful manifestations of divine power, the simple assurance that our Redeemer is near us is enough to allay our fears, and diffuse calmness through the soul.
