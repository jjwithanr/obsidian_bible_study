# Revelation 20

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.11
>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.

That is, as the stars, at the rising of the sun, seem to flee to more remote regions, and vanish from human view, so when the Son of God shall descend in his glory to judge the world, the earth and all other worlds shall seem to vanish. Every one must admire the sublimity of this image; no one can contemplate it without being awed by the majesty and glory of the final Judge of mankind. Similar expressions, where the natural creation shrinks back with awe at the presence of God, frequently occur in the Bible. Compare [Psalm 18:7-15](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/18-7.htm); [Psalm 77:16-19](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/77-16.htm); [Psalm 114:3-5](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/114-3.htm); [Habakkuk 3:6](https://biblehub.com/niv/habakkuk/3-6.htm), [Habakkuk 3:10-11](https://biblehub.com/niv/habakkuk/3-10.htm).
