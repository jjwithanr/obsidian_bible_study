# Revelation 3

## Overview:



#### v.1
>"To the angel of the church in Sardis write:
>These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; **you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.**"

Despite the city’s paganism, the Christian community there seems to have experienced no persecution—and no spiritual life. Sardis had a large, powerful and wealthy Jewish community that had long been a respected part of civic life; their \*synagogue was roughly the length of a football field, with some of the city’s best real estate. Like the Jewish community, the church was probably tolerated.

“The great characteristic of Sardis was that, even on pagan lips, Sardis was a name of contempt. Its people were notoriously loose-living, notoriously pleasure-and luxury loving. Sardis was a city of the decadence.” (Barclay)

#### v.2
>Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God.

In its history, the city of Sardis was easily conquered twice before. It wasn’t that the attacking armies overwhelmed Sardis, but because overconfidence made them stop being **watchful**. The spiritual state of the church in Sardis was a reflection of the city’s historical character.

Be a watchman, JJ. The church in America has its reputation, but is it alive? We need watchmen in this hour to wake up the dead, sleeping church. Habakkuk 2:1

#### v.3
>Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; obey it, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.

#### v.4
>Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.

But what shall be done with such persons as live in the church, but are not of it, having a name to live, but are dead? **What shall be done with mere professors who are not possessors?** What shall become of those who are only outwardly religious but inwardly are in the gall of bitterness? We answer, as good Calvin did once: ‘They shall walk in black, for they are unworthy.’ They shall walk in black – the blackness of God’s destruction. They shall walk in black – the blackness of hopeless despair. They shall walk in black – the blackness of incomparable anguish. They shall walk in black – the blackness of damnation. They shall walk in black for ever, because they were found unworthy.

#### v.5
>He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels.

#### v.7
>What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.

A man once came to Spurgeon and asked how he could win others to Jesus. Spurgeon asked him, “What are you? What do you do?”

The man said, “I’m an engine driver on a train.”

“Then,” said Spurgeon, “Is the man who shovels coal on your train a Christian?”

“I don’t know,” said the man.

“Go back,” said Spurgeon, “and find out and start on him.”

#### v.8
>I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet **you have kept my word and have not denied my name.**

The term **a little strength** does not imply weakness, but _real_ **strength**. They were weak enough to be strong in the Lord. We can be “too strong” or “too big” or too sure of ourselves for God to really use us. The church in Philadelphia had the poverty of spirit to know they really needed God’s strength.

“It is not a matter of great strength, not great ability but great dependability. Samson had great ability but poor dependability. A little strength faithfully used means more than much strength flashily and fitfully used.” (Havner)

#### v.11
>I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.

“Never forget that the man most likely to steal your crown is _yourself_. ‘Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life’ ([Proverbs 4:23](Proverbs4.md#v.23)). You are in no greater danger from anyone or anything than from yourself.” (Havner)

#### v.12
>Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the **name of the city of my God**, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him **my new name.**

#### v.14
> “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation.

#### v.15
>I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!

#### v.16
>So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth.

 “Hot water heals, cold water refreshes, but lukewarm water is useless for either purpose.” (L. Morris) It was as if Jesus said, “If you were hot or cold I could do something with you. But because you are neither, I will do nothing.” The lukewarm Christian has enough of Jesus to satisfy a craving for religion, but not enough for eternal life.

 We know His deepest desire is that they be **hot**, with an on-fire love for Him (see [Revelation 3:19](Revelation3#v.19), where the word _zealous_ is associated with this same word **hot**). Yet if they would not be **hot**, Jesus _preferred_**cold** rather than **lukewarm**. “So the Lord is saying, ‘If instead of being lukewarm, you were so cold that should feel that coldness, then the very feeling of your need might drive you to the true warmth, but now in your lukewarmness, you have just enough to protect yourselves against a feeling of need.'

 #### v.17
>You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.

Paul Washer says "true prayer is born out of need". The root cause of the church of Laodicea's lukewarmness was their failure to acknowledge their need of God.

**“The cause of Christ has been hurt more by Sunday-morning bench-warmers who pretend to love Christ, who call Him Lord but do not His commands, than by all the publicans and sinners.” (Havner)**
#enduringword 

Too many bench-warmers harm the starting team. They act as busy-bodies who suggest they can supply the starting team with rest but are instead empty promises. They have nothing to offer to the team.

#### v.19
>Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent.

“It is, in fact, God’s final punishment to leave a man alone.” (Barclay)
