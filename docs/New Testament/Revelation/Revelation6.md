_Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand._ ([Romans 5:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Romans+5.1-2&t=NKJV))

 _I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you also received and in which you stand._ ([1 Corinthians 15:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Corinthians+15.1&t=NKJV))

 _Testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand._ ([1 Peter 5:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=1Peter+5.12&t=NKJV))

The believer can stand in the face of this great wrath of God because Jesus already bore the wrath the believer deserved.
