# Revelation 12

## Overview:


#### v.6
>The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.

#### v.10
>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
>"Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down."

In times past, Satan's chief role as adversary was directed toward accusing God's people of disobedience to God. The justice of these accusations was recognized by God, and therefore Satan's presence in heaven was tolerated. But now the presence of the crucified Savior in God's presence provides the required satisfaction of God's justice regarding our sins (1Jn 2:1-2; 4:10). Thus, Satan's accusations are no longer valid and he is cast out.

#### v.11
>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.

#### v.14
>The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach.

#### v.17
>Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring - those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

“It is precisely when Satan has lost the battle for the souls of saints in heaven that he begins the fruitless persecution of their bodies.” (Farrer)
