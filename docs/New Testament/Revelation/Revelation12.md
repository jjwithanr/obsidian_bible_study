# Revelation 12

## Overview:



#### v.10
>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
>"Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down."

#### v.11
>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.

#### v.17
>Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring - those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

“It is precisely when Satan has lost the battle for the souls of saints in heaven that he begins the fruitless persecution of their bodies.” (Farrer)
