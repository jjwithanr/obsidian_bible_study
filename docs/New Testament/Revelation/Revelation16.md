# Revelation 16

## Overview:


#### v.9
>They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.

Those who are not won by _grace_ will never be won.

i. “The wishful thinking of some that men would repent if they only knew the power and righteous judgment of God is shattered by frequent mention in this chapter of the hardness of the human heart in the face of the most stringent and evident divine discipline.” (Walvoord)
