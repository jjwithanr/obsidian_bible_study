# Revelation 7

## Overview:



#### v.9
>After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.

#### v.14
>I answered, "Sir, you know."
>And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb"

#### v.16
>Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat.

#### v.17
>For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."

Tribulation produces tears. Like a tenderhearted, devoted mother, God will wipe each tear from their eyes with the eternal consolations of glory itself. Never again will they cry out because of pain and suffering.
