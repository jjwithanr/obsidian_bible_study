# Mark 7

## Overview:



#### v.8
>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."

#### v.15
>Nothing outside a man can make him 'unlean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean'."

#### v.21-22
>For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup>22</sup>greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly.

#### v.24
>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. 

Jesus keeps his presence secret from the proud Pharisees but lets himself be found the humble Syrophoenician woman.

#### v.37
>People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and mute speak."

The spirit of excellence inside Jesus induces such wonder for the world who has never seen none so Excellent.

Miracles and his parables stirred wonder, but it was the spirit that does everything well beneath it all that overwhelmed them with amazement.

Happy would it be if all his followers, and especially his ministers, would learn of him, who was thus meek and lowly; neither acting as in their own strength, when they attempt a spiritual cure, nor proclaiming their own praise when they have effected it. Then would they likewise do all things well; and there would be that beauty in the manner, which no wise man would entirely neglect, even in those actions which are in themselves most excellent and great.
