# Mark 11

## Overview:


#### v.10
>“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”

#### v.11
>Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.

He saw the abominations and abuses which he afterward corrected. It may be a matter of wonder that he did not "at once" correct them, instead of waiting to another day; but it may be observed that God is slow to anger; that he does not "at once" smite the guilty, but **waits patiently before he rebukes and chastises.**

#### v.17
>And as he taught them, he said, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”

#### v.22
>“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.

Literally, "Have the faith of God." This may mean, have strong faith, or have confidence in God; a strong belief that he is able to accomplish things that appear most difficult with infinite ease, as the fig-tree was made to wither away by a word.

#### v.24
>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

We should rest in no religion that does not make us fruitful in good works. Christ taught them from hence to pray in faith. It may be applied to that mighty faith with which all true Christians are endued, and which does wonders in spiritual things.

#### v.25
>And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”

#### v.33
>So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”

(3) NEVER DEFEND YOURSELF.
We’re all born with a desire to defend ourselves. And if you insist upon defending yourself, God will let you do it. But if you turn the defense of yourself over to God He will defend you.

Whoever defends himself will have himself for defense, and he will have no other. But let him come defenseless before the Lord and he will have for his defender no less than God Himself.
