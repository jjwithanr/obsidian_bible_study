# Mark 6

## Overview:


#### v.2
>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. “Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing?

#### v.3
>Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.

#### v.4
>Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.”

#### v.5-6
>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. <sup>6</sup>He was amazed at their lack of faith.

We are not to suppose that his power was limited by the belief or unbelief of people; but they were so "prejudiced," so set against him, that they were not in a condition to "judge of evidence" and to be convinced. They would have charged it to derangement, or sorcery, or the agency of the devil. Compare [John 10:20](John10.md#v.20). It would have been of no use, therefore, in proving to them that he was from God, to have worked miracles. He did, therefore, only those things which were the proper work of benevolence, and which could not easily be charged on the devil. He gave "sufficient" proof of his mission, and left them in their chosen unbelief without excuse. It is also true, in spiritual things, that the unbelief of a people prevents the influences of the Holy Spirit from being sent down to bless them. God requires faith. He hears only the prayers of faith. And when there is little true belief, and prayer is cold and formal, there the people sleep in spiritual death and are unblessed.

#### v.12
>They went out and preached that people should repent.

The work of the Apostles appears from this to have been a continuation of that of the Baptist. They announced the nearness of the kingdom of God, and repentance as the one adequate preparation for it, and baptised as the outward token of that repentance and the new life in which it was to issue ([John 3:5](John3#v.5); [John 4:2](John4#v.2)), but they did not as yet proclaim their Master as being Himself the Christ, and therefore the Head of that kingdom.

#### v.34
>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.

Compassion led to Jesus teaching the crowds.

#### v.46
>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.

#### v.50
>because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”

#### v.51-52
>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, <sup>52</sup>for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.

Their "mind" was dull to perceive it. This does not mean that they were "opposed" to Jesus, or that they had what we denominate "hardness of heart," but simply that they were slow to perceive his power. They did not quickly learn, as they ought to have done, that he had all power, and could therefore allay the storm.

This entire episode is an illustration of God giving the Twelve what they need. Although they didn't get to debrief their missions trip, they do get time away from the crowds. They didn't bring food, but God provided (Mark 6:39–43). The next day, when the crowd finds them again, Jesus will say, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst" ([John 6:35](John6#v.35)). Jesus will show that man lives on the Word of God, not by bread alone ([Matthew 4:1–4](Matthew4#v.4)) when He tells the Twelve that to do God's will is more satisfying than bread ([John 4:31–34](John4#v.34)). For a while yet, however, the Twelve will miss the point that **if we trust and obey God, He will take care of us** ([Mark 8:16–21](Mark8#v.17)).
