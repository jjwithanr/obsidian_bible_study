# Mark 8

## Overview:


#### v.29
>“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”

What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.

#### v.33
>But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. “Get behind me, Satan!” he said. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”

#### v.34
>Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

As the happiness of heaven with Christ, is enough to make up for the loss of life itself for him, so the gain of all the world in sin, will not make up for the ruin of the soul by sin. And there is a day coming, when the cause of Christ will appear as glorious, as some now think it mean and contemptible. May we think of that season, and view every earthly object as we shall do at that great day.

#### v.35
>For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.

#### v.36
>What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

#### v.37
>Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?

#### v.38
>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.”
