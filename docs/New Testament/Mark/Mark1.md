# Mark 1

## Overview:


#### v.4
>And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

#### v.8
>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”

#### v.15
>“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”

#### v.20
>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

#### v.22
>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as teachers of the law.

See more in [[preaching#Maclaren on Mark 1 22 Mark1 v 22]].

#### v.34
>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

His plan—to reveal Himself as the Messiah, God, and the Son of God—was not served by the testimony of His enemy. One of Satan's favorite tools is to twist the truth to his own ends. Jesus would not let the demons lay a hand on the truth to twist it.

#### v.35
>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.

See more in [[morning#Barnes on Mark 1 35 Mark1 v 35]].

Could it be that the intensity of the previous evening's ministry gave Him an even greater urgency to be with His Father in the morning? One thing seems clear: It wasn't an especially long night. **Even when His body craved more sleep, Jesus knows his true source of revitalization would not be on His back but on His face.**

#### v.40-41
>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” <sup>41</sup>Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”
