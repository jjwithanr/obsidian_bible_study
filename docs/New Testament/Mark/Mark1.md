#### v.4
>And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

#### v.8
>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”

#### v.12-13
>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, <sup>13</sup>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.

Sources suggest that many believed that demons were especially attracted to places like pagan temples, bathhouses, graveyards and deserts. Readers would thus sense the suspense as Jesus battled with Satan on Satan’s own turf. Safety among beasts showed God’s protection ([Ezek 34:25](Ezekiel34#v.25); [Dan 6:22](Daniel6#v.22)).

#### v.15
>“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”

In Mk 1:15 the kingdom is emphasized as having drawn near in the person of Jesus. The only appropriate response is repentance and faith. There is an urgency about the nearness of God's kingdom. Since it ushers in the End, it speaks of judgement

#### v.20
>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

#### v.22
>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as teachers of the law.

See more in [[preaching#Maclaren on Mark 1 22 Mark1 v 22]].

#### v.23-24
>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, <sup>24</sup>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"

The place that Jesus encounters his first demon may shock Mark’s readers: it is in a religious setting.

Demons (also occasionally called “unclean spirits,” e.g., \*Jubilees 10:1) were often associated with \*magic, and magicians tried to subdue other spiritual forces by invoking their names. If the demon here is trying to subdue Jesus in this way (“I know who you are” was used to subdue spiritual powers in magical texts), as some scholars have suggested, this ploy does not work... in Jewish literature, demons recognized their inability to harm those who walked close to God.

#### v.34
>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

His plan—to reveal Himself as the Messiah, God, and the Son of God—was not served by the testimony of His enemy. One of Satan's favorite tools is to twist the truth to his own ends. Jesus would not let the demons lay a hand on the truth to twist it.

#### v.35
>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.

See more in [[morning#Barnes on Mark 1 35 Mark1 v 35]].

Could it be that the intensity of the previous evening's ministry gave Him an even greater urgency to be with His Father in the morning? One thing seems clear: It wasn't an especially long night. **Even when His body craved more sleep, Jesus knows his true source of revitalization would not be on His back but on His face.**

Jesus, after a busy evening of healing and exorcisms got up early the next morning and sought a quiet place to pray (cf.[ 6:46](Mark6#v.46); [14:32-41](Mark14)). **He was facing a crisis—the shallow and superficial response of the people who were only interested in what he could do to heal their physical afflictions. So he sought the strength that only communion and fellowship with the Father could provide.**
The disciples did not understand Jesus or his need for communion with the Father, so they went to look for him. Apparently the thought Jesus would be pleased to know that everyone was looking for him (v.37). **They did not understand that this popular and shallow reception of him was the very reason he withdrew to pray.**

#### v.40-41
>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” <sup>41</sup>Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”

Having no doubt that Jesus could heal him, he wondered only whether Jesus was willing. **It is sometimes easier to believe in God's power than in his mercy.**
