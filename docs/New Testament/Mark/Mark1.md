### Big Idea
The good news centers on Jesus the Messiah, who shows himself to be the Son of God by inaugurating God’s kingdom age. He is declared as such first by Old Testament prophecy and then by the wilderness voice, his forerunner John the Baptist.
### Key Themes of Mark 1:1–8
- Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God, which is the core of the kingdom message.
- As messianic forerunner, John introduces the fulfillment of the Isaianic promise by preparing the way for the coming of Jesus.
- As wilderness prophet, John introduces the nation to the need for repentance and confession for forgiveness.

#### v.4
>And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

#### v.8
>I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”

#### v.12-13
>At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, <sup>13</sup>and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.

Sources suggest that many believed that demons were especially attracted to places like pagan temples, bathhouses, graveyards and deserts. Readers would thus sense the suspense as Jesus battled with Satan on Satan’s own turf. Safety among beasts showed God’s protection ([Ezek 34:25](Ezekiel34#v.25); [Dan 6:22](Daniel6#v.22)).

It is debated whether this continues the idea of the wilderness testing, with the animals as hostile predators, or whether this is part of a “paradise” theme, as the animals are reconciled [(Isa. 11:6–9](Isaiah11#v.6)) and the wilderness transformed with Jesus, the new Adam. As part of a new creation theme, the latter view has merit. There are two negative elements (the wilderness, Satan) and two positive elements (the animals, the angels).

Mark's account of the temptation is brief, recording no specific temptation and no victory over Satan. This emphasizes that Jesus' entire ministry was one continuous encounter with the devil and not limited to a few temptations in the desert... Only Mark mentions the "wild animals"—a touch that heightens the fierceness of Jesus' entire temptation experience.

#### v.15
>“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”

In Mk 1:15 the kingdom is emphasized as having drawn near in the person of Jesus. The only appropriate response is repentance and faith. There is an urgency about the nearness of God's kingdom. Since it ushers in the End, it speaks of judgement

There are four elements, the first two providing God’s part and the last two our part. This verse refers to “the fullness of time,” as in [Galatians 4:4](Galatians4#v.4), the decisive moment of salvation history when all the hopes of the Old Testament would be fulfilled. [Luke 3:1](Luke3#v.1) tells us that Jesus began his ministry in the fifteenth year of the emperor Tiberias, and [John 2:20](John2#v.20) that it was the forty-sixth year after Herod began to rebuild the temple. This would correspond to AD 27–28, when Jesus was thirty-three or thirty-four (he probably was born in 6 BC).

Mark often stresses the encounter with Christ, and the only proper response is to repent (see 1:4 above) and come to a faith decision. As in 1:1, the kingdom message is called the “gospel” or “good news.”

#### v.20
>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

#### v.22
>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as teachers of the law.

See more in [[preaching#Maclaren on Mark 1 22 Mark1 v 22]].

#### v.23-24
>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, <sup>24</sup>"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"

The place that Jesus encounters his first demon may shock Mark’s readers: it is in a religious setting.

Demons (also occasionally called “unclean spirits,” e.g., \*Jubilees 10:1) were often associated with \*magic, and magicians tried to subdue other spiritual forces by invoking their names. If the demon here is trying to subdue Jesus in this way (“I know who you are” was used to subdue spiritual powers in magical texts), as some scholars have suggested, this ploy does not work... in Jewish literature, demons recognized their inability to harm those who walked close to God.

#### v.34
>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.

His plan—to reveal Himself as the Messiah, God, and the Son of God—was not served by the testimony of His enemy. One of Satan's favorite tools is to twist the truth to his own ends. Jesus would not let the demons lay a hand on the truth to twist it.

#### v.35
>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.

See more in [[morning#Barnes on Mark 1 35 Mark1 v 35]].

Could it be that the intensity of the previous evening's ministry gave Him an even greater urgency to be with His Father in the morning? One thing seems clear: It wasn't an especially long night. **Even when His body craved more sleep, Jesus knows his true source of revitalization would not be on His back but on His face.**
#bobsorge 

Jesus, after a busy evening of healing and exorcisms got up early the next morning and sought a quiet place to pray (cf.[ 6:46](Mark6#v.46); [14:32-41](Mark14)). **He was facing a crisis—the shallow and superficial response of the people who were only interested in what he could do to heal their physical afflictions. So he sought the strength that only communion and fellowship with the Father could provide.**
The disciples did not understand Jesus or his need for communion with the Father, so they went to look for him. Apparently the thought Jesus would be pleased to know that everyone was looking for him (v.37). **They did not understand that this popular and shallow reception of him was the very reason he withdrew to pray.**
#walterwessel 

#### v.38
>Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."

#### v.40-41
>A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” <sup>41</sup>Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”

Having no doubt that Jesus could heal him, he wondered only whether Jesus was willing. **It is sometimes easier to believe in God's power than in his mercy.**
