# Mark 9

## Overview:

#### v.1
>And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste deaht before they see the kingdom of God come with power."

It seems most natural to interpret this promise in [Matthew 16:28](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2016.28); [Mark 9:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark%209.1); and [Luke 9:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Luke%209.27) as a reference to the transfiguration, which "some" of the disciples would witness only six days later, exactly as Jesus predicted. In each Gospel, the very next passage after this promise from Jesus is the transfiguration, which shows Jesus in all His glory which will be seen again in the Kingdom of God. The contextual links make it very likely that this is the proper interpretation.

#### v.23
>" 'If you can?' " said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."

#### v.24
>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; hep me overcome my unbelief!"


#### v.30-31
>They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want to anyone to know where they were, <sup>31</sup>because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."

Jesus witheld certain teachings from the crowd for his disciples. He knows what revelation we are capable of stewarding. As we are held accountable to "consider carefully how we listen", Jesus also considers carefully what he says to us.

#### v.40
>for whoever is not against us is for us.

This verse may be the clearest objection the today's culture of competitively ambitious ministries striving to claim enough soil to show off the most fruit.

#### v.49
>Everyone will be salted with fire.

Brethren, for a man by his own unaided effort, however powerful, continuous, and wisely directed it may be, to cleanse himself utterly from his iniquity, is as hopeless as it would be for him to sit down with a hammer and a chisel and try by mechanical means to get all the iron out of a piece of ironstone. **The union is chemical, not mechanical.** And so hammers and chisels will only get a very little of the metal out. The one solvent is fire.

#### v.50
>"Salt is good, but if it loses it saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be a peace with each other."

Salt keeps dead things dead and enhances what is living.

Jesus' last phrase brings us back around to Mark 9:33–35 when the disciples are arguing about who is greatest. While they are worried about their position in Jesus' kingdom, He is concerned with the church reaching new believers (Mark 9:36–37, 39–40) and the personal sacrifices required for obedience (Mark 9:42–47).  
Matthew and Luke add that the un-salty will be thrown out and trampled on, which is basically what the disciples wanted to do to the man who was exorcising demons in Jesus' name (Mark 9:38). Jesus explains that position and authority are not necessarily markers of how closely we follow Him. The ability to bring out the best in others and bring peace is a much better test.
