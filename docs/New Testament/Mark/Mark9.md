# Mark 9

## Overview:

#### v.1
>And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."

It seems most natural to interpret this promise in [Matthew 16:28](Matthew16#v.28); [Mark 9:1](Mark9#v.1); and [Luke 9:27](Luke9#v.27)) as a reference to the transfiguration, which "some" of the disciples would witness only six days later, exactly as Jesus predicted. In each Gospel, the very next passage after this promise from Jesus is the transfiguration, which shows Jesus in all His glory which will be seen again in the Kingdom of God. The contextual links make it very likely that this is the proper interpretation.

#### v.19
>“O unbelieving generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”

It's chilling for us to realize that if we do not live in faith of God, we can be lumped together with false teachers who reject Jesus. God does invite us into His work, but not because He needs our own skill or power. We need faith in His power and direction, and we need to be in prayer (Mark 9:29). An effective prayer life reminds us how much we need Him, acknowledges His work around us, and keeps us open to His guidance.

#### v.23
>" 'If you can?' " said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."

Weak faith is faith. The tremulous hand does touch. The cord may be slender as a spider’s web that binds a heart to Jesus, but it does bind. The poor woman in the other miracle who put out her wasted finger-tip, coming behind Him in the crowd, and stealthily touching the hem of His garment, though it was only the end of her finger-nail that was laid on the robe, carried away with her the blessing. And so the feeblest faith joins the soul, in the measure of its strength, to Jesus Christ.

#### v.24
>Immediately the boy’s father cried out and was saying, “I do believe; help my unbelief.

The man felt the implied rebuke in the Saviour's language; and feeling grieved that he should be thought to be destitute of faith, and feeling deeply for the welfare of his afflicted son, he wept. Nothing can be more touching or natural than this. An anxious father, distressed at the condition of his son, having applied to the disciples in vain, now coming to the Saviour; and not having full confidence that he had the proper qualification to be aided, he wept. Any man would have wept in his condition, nor would the Saviour turn the weeping suppliant away.

Give me strength and grace to put "entire" confidence in thee. Everyone who comes to the Saviour for help has need of offering this prayer. In our unbelief and our doubts we need his aid, nor shall we ever put sufficient reliance on him without his gracious help.

#### v.29
>He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting."

#### v.30-31
>They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want to anyone to know where they were, <sup>31</sup>because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."

Jesus witheld certain teachings from the crowd for his disciples. He knows what revelation we are capable of stewarding. **As we are held accountable to "consider carefully how we listen", Jesus also considers carefully what he says to us.**

#### v.40
>for whoever is not against us is for us.

This verse may be the clearest objection to competitively ambitious ministries striving to claim enough soil to show off the most fruit.
#jj 

#### v.49
>Everyone will be salted with fire.

Brethren, for a man by his own unaided effort, however powerful, continuous, and wisely directed it may be, to cleanse himself utterly from his iniquity, is as hopeless as it would be for him to sit down with a hammer and a chisel and try by mechanical means to get all the iron out of a piece of ironstone. **The union is chemical, not mechanical.** And so hammers and chisels will only get a very little of the metal out. The one solvent is fire.

#### v.50
>"Salt is good, but if it loses it saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be a peace with each other."

Salt keeps dead things dead and enhances what is living.

Jesus' last phrase brings us back around to Mark 9:33–35 when the disciples are arguing about who is greatest. While they are worried about their position in Jesus' kingdom, He is concerned with the church reaching new believers (Mark 9:36–37, 39–40) and the personal sacrifices required for obedience (Mark 9:42–47).
Matthew and Luke add that the un-salty will be thrown out and trampled on, which is basically what the disciples wanted to do to the man who was exorcising demons in Jesus' name (Mark 9:38). Jesus explains that position and authority are not necessarily markers of how closely we follow Him. The ability to bring out the best in others and bring peace is a much better test.
