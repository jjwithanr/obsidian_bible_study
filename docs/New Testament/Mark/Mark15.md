#### v.21
>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.

This Rufus is likely the same one referenced by Paul in [Romans 16:13](Romans16#v.13).

Luke records men from Cyrene being among those converted at Pentecost ([Acts 2:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%202.10)). After the martyrdom of Stephen ([Acts 7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%207)), believers from Cyrene were among the first to be scattered by the persecution in Jerusalem; arriving in Antioch, they preached to the Gentiles there ([Acts 11:20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%2011.20)). These believers were instrumental in the formation of the church at Antioch, where, for the first time, “the disciples were called Christians” ([Acts 11:26](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%2011.26)).
