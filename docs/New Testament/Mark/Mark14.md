# Mark 14

## Overview:



#### v.4-5
>Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume? <sup>5</sup>It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.

Jesus found more value in the posture of her heart rather than the perceived value of her sacrifice.

#### v.8
>**She did what she could.** She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.

She did what she could. I must do what I can. See more in [[meekness,greatness#Tozer]].

The question is not how much have I done, or given, but **could I have done or given more?**
And that is the law for us Christian people, because the Christian life is to be ruled by the great law of self-sacrifice, as the only adequate expression of our recognition of, and our being affected by, the great Sacrifice that gave Himself for us.

She has showed the highest attachment in her power; and it was, as it is now, a sufficient argument against there being any "real" waste, that it was done for the honor of Christ.

#### v.38
>Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."

#### v.39
>Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.

Last night was the first time I saw Edward face to face since March of 2020. Amidst the discouragement of the path he's now on, I wrestle with whether it is the Lord's will for me to keep praying for him. This is the sign. Once I'll return to the prayer closet and *pray the same thing.*

When Jesus returned to check on his disciple's status after a short time, they were of a disappointing disposition. Yet, His love for them brought him back to the place of prayer while knowing the Son of Man would be betrayed by his closest friends.

Oh Lord, you're not done with Edward. I just want tickets to the front row seat of seeing the story of his life unfold. Something greater than the rebellion is coming.

#### v.72
>Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.

Oh Lord, would your word be hidden in my heart that I might not sin against you. I forget to remember your word.
