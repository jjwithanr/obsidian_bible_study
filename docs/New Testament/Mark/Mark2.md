# Mark 2

## Overview:



#### v.8
>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"

There are thoughts Jesus may question us about: why do you think such things?
#jj

#### v.12
>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"

#### v.14
>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.

Jesus sees the individual among the masses. [[Mark16#v 7]].

#### v.17
>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

Jesus responds to the silent criticisms against him and to the vocal accusations of his disciples. He is the defender of both God's glory and his disciples. There's something about how verse 8 and verse 17.

#### v.19-20
>Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. <sup>20</sup>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.

There is a time to ask and a time to receive. Lord, make us aware of the times we are living in.
#jj see [[prayer#Spurgeon on Exodus 14 15 Exodus14 v 15]].

#### v.22
>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.”

Christianity teaches differently: that God will change our hearts to want to do what He wants us to do ([Philippians 2:13](Philippians2#v.13)). This is how we love God ([John 14:15](John14#v.15); [1 John 5:3](1John5#v.3)). To try to fit Jesus' teachings of love and freedom into the Pharisaical legalism (or even its modern-day equivalences) would have resulted in a burst tradition and pieces of love and freedom spilled out all over the floor.

#### v.27
>Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.

In short, Jesus makes it clear that the Law has a greater purpose than to be followed with blind, careless literalism. There is a meaning behind God's law, and some of God's purposes are higher than others. Caring for the needs of the needy, for instance, is more important than ceremonial rituals.
