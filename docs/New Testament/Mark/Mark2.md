# Mark 2

## Overview:



#### v.8
>Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"

There are thoughts Jesus may inquire similarly of us. Why do we think such things?

#### v.12
>He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"

[[wonder,amazement]]

#### v.14
>As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.

Jesus sees the individual among the masses. [[Mark16#v 7]].

#### v.17
>On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

Jesus responds to the silent criticisms against him and to the vocal accusations of his disciples. He is the defender of both God's glory and his disciples. There's something about how verse 8 and verse 17.
