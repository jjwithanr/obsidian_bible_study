# Mark 4

## Overview:
Same as [[Luke8]].


#### v.13
>Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?"

The inability to properly cultivate the soils of our hearts prevents us from being able to understand everything else Jesus says. The meaning was supposed to be straightforward.

He implies that the meaning of the parable of the sower is clear and understandable. If the disciples could not understand this clear parable, how would they understand more obscure ones?

#### v.24-25
>"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to youâ€”and even more. <sup>25</sup>Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."

The parable of the measure begins with an exhortation to spiritual perception. The more one listens to the word of Jesus with spiritual perception and appropriates it, the more the truth about Jesus will be revealed. Furthermore, the more one appropriates the truth now, the more one will receive in the future. On the other hand, whoever does not lay hold of the word now, even the little spiritual perception that person has will be taken away.

#### v.38
>Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"

The disciples' rebuke of Jesus indicates that they did not know who he really was.

Our questions reveal our revelation of who Jesus is in our lives.
