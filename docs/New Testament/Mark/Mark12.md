# Mark 12

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.17
>Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.

Give to God what is God's could be call to give our lives to Him. He that [made us in His own image](Genesis1#v.27) shows that we belong to Him and ought to give our lives to Him.

#### v.44
>They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything - all she had to live on."

Many give out of the wealth of their faith, gifting, and authority yet hold back the totality of their heart's devotion. The widow gave out of her sincere poverty yielding all of her heart's peripheral desires. Similar to [Luke 17:5](Luke17#v.5-6).

That the highest evidence of love to the cause of religion is not the "amount" given, but the amount compared with our means.

That God does not despise the humblest offering, if made in sincerity. He loves a cheerful giver.

We may remark that few practice self-denial for the purpose of charity. Most give of their abundance - that is, what they can spare without feeling it, and many feel that this is the same as throwing it away. Among all the thousands who give to these objects, how few deny themselves of one comfort, even the least, that they may advance the kingdom of Christ!
