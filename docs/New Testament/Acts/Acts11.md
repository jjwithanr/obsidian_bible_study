# Acts 11

## Overview:


#### v.18
>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life."

The believers in Jerusalem marvel that God has given “even the Gentiles” (cf. niv, nrsv; likelier than merely “also”—kjv, nasb, gnt) the gift. Jewish people believed that Gentiles could be saved by converting to Judaism; many also believed that Gentiles could be saved simply by being righteous, which for some meant keeping the seven laws God gave to Noah (according to developing Jewish tradition). But no one had believed that Gentiles could be welcomed on the same terms as Jewish people, who had been chosen for salvation by God’s sovereign \*grace. More importantly, more conservative Jewish movements (such as the \*Essenes) believed that even most Jewish people were lost, so the salvation of the Gentiles without fully embracing Judaism appeared difficult.
