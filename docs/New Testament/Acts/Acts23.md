# Acts 23

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day."

#### v.3
>Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!"

Indignant at the affront, Paul lashed out at Ananias and accused him of breaking the Jewish law, which safeguarded the rights of defendants and presumed them innocent until proven guilty. Paul was not yet charged with a crime, let alone tried and found guilty.
Anyone who behaved as Ananias did, Paul knew, was bound to come under God's judgement. Paul's words were more prophetic than he realized, for Ananias' finals days were lived as a hunted animal and ended at the hands of his own people.

#### v.11
>The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."
