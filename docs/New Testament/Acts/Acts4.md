# Acts 4

## Overview:


#### v.12
>Salvation is found in no one else, for there is **no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.**

The first issue to address is the meaning of *salvation*. Salvation is a special interest of the author of Luke-Acts. It can mean deliverance from everything from sickness to sin, from political oppression to divine judgement. The lame man in Acts 3-4 had been saved by being healed, while Zechariah speaks of salvation in terms of deliverance from the political enemies of Israel (Lk 1:71). Acts 27:31 refers to rescue from a storm at sea as salvation. But a further issue is one of escaping divine judgement (Acts 2:21, 40). This escape not only is a rescue, but also has a positive side, namely, "that times of refreshment may come from the Lord" (Acts 3:19). This last meaning dominates the speeches in Acts. Thus while the author certainly knows many meanings for salvation (for example, that Jesus is the one thorgh whom physical healing comes), the stress in this passage is on what he believes is the most significant meaning, salvation in its fullest sense: deliverance from divine judgement and the release of the blessings of God. This type of salvation, he states, comes only through Jesus Christ.

It is significant that Peter makes this statement in front of Jewish leaders. Their Judaism could not save them. They needed the one "name," the name of Jesus. This theme of the exclusiveness of salvation through Christ is repeated a number of times in Acts, but perhaps Paul puts it most starkly against Athenian Greek religion and philosophy when he states, "In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world wit hjustice by the man [Jesus] he has apointed" ([Acts 17:30-21](Acts17)). In othe rwords, the teaching throughout Acts (and the rest of the New Testament, for that matter) is that there is only one way to escpae God's judgement and receive his favor, and that is through Jesus. This exclusivity is a consistent claim of the early church.
