# Acts 3

## Overview:


#### v.5
>So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.

Lord, I repent of making my time with you transactional. I know you are my Father in heaven who loves me, knows what I need, cares after my needs, and leads me in this life. I repent of solely giving you attention just so I can get something from you. Lord, take me back to my first love where all I want is you.

#### v.6
>Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."

Ancient miracle workers usually prayed or invoked spirits rather than commanded the sick person to be healed (the \*New Testament also recommends prayer - Jas 5:14); but \*Old Testament has ample precendent for doing miracles by simply declaring the word of the Lord, as a prophet speaking God's will (e.g. 2 Kings 1:10; 2:14;, 21-22, 24; 4:43; 5:10).

#### v.10
>they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with **wonder and amazement** at what had happened to him.

Signs and wonders often provide opportunity for witness in Acts, but Luke's primary emphasis is always on the proclamation of the good news itself.

#### v.12
>When Peter saw this, he said to them: "Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?"

Jewish people often thought wonder workers did miracles (e.g. causing rain) by their great piety. Luke emphasizes that the \*apostles were normal people, filled with God's \*Spirit ([Acts 14:15](Acts14#v.15)).

#### v.18
>But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer.

Later Jewish teachers sometimes said hyperbolically that the entire message of the prophets dealt with the messianic era or Jerusalem's restoration, or with other favorite topics. Some later rabbis said that a \*Messiah would suffer and spoke of two Messiahas, one who would suffer and one who would reign, but the Christians seem to have been the first to proclaim the concept of a suffering Messiah.

#### v.22-23
>For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you. <sup>23</sup>Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cutoff from among his people.'

Evidence against limited atonement? Unbelievers are condemned for their sin of rejecting Christ, not because Christ did not pay the penalty for their sins.

#### v.26
>When God raised up his servant, he sent him **first to you** to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.

Peter's hearers are spiritually "heirs of the prophets"; on the prophecies, see comment on 3:18. Because Abraham's blessing for the nations/families of the earth (Gen 12:3; 22:18) was to come through Israel, the servant (3:13) had been sent to be the blessing to them first.

Thank you, Lord, for your discipline. Thank you for blessing me by turning me from my addiction of YouTube, gluttony, indolence, pride, etc. What a blessing to hear your voice! Even when it is disciplinary.
