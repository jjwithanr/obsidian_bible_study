# Acts 10

## Overview:



#### v.2
>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.

Lord, make me like Cornelius in my future family. May I be a father who disciples his children well and loves his wife deeply that they may be devout and God-fearing all their lives. Father, I ask for you to humble my heart and keep it away from the love of money that I may give generously to those in need. Lord, sustain me in the place of prayer in all seasons of my life. Amen.

#### v.4
>Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked.
>The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a **memorial offering** before God."

They were an evidence of piety toward God, and were accepted as such. Though he had not offered sacrifice according to the Jewish laws; though he had not been circumcised; yet, having acted according to the light which he had, his prayers were hard, and his alms were accepted. This was done in accordance with the general principle of the divine administration, that **God prefers the offering of the heart to external forms; the expressions of love to sacrifice without it.**

It should be remembered, however, that Cornelius was not depending on external morality. His heart was in the work of religion. It should be remembered, further, that he was ready to receive the gospel when it was offered to him, and to become a Christian. In this there was an important difference between him and those who are depending for salvation on their morality in Christian lands

#### v.25
>As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.

#### v.26
>But Peter made him gte up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself."

Similar sentiment to his greeting in [2 Peter 1:1](2Peter1#v.1).

Another time that I remember the Spirit illuminating Scripture to me. Peter has the humility as an apostle and leader in the early church to ensure that believers did not put him or his faith on pedastol.

Greco-Roman paganism believed not only in gods but in semidivine men, often sons of the gods, who had supernatural powers (14:11; 28:6; cf. 12:22-23). One would offer obeisance to gods by falling at their feet and worshiping them, as Cornelius does to Peter here. Cornelius should know better (10:2) than to treat Peter with such reverence; perhaps he intends only a special form of homage (as was customary for Eastern rulers), which a servant of Jesus finds inappropriate (cf. Lk 22:25-27). Even Greeks considered it hubris for a mortal to accept worship, and respected those who declined divine honors. Yet people often fell at others’ feet or sometimes grasped their knees (an ancient Greek approach) to beg for mercy or an essential request.

#### v.44
>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.

#### v.45-46
>The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup>46</sup>For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.

Most Jewish teachers felt that the Spirit inspired only the most pious with divine utterances, or that the Spirit would mark God’s people in the future age. That Gentiles would receive the gift was unthinkable. Most importantly, the Spirit was an \*eschatological promise only for the people of the covenant (e.g., Is 44:3; Ezek 39:29). Gentiles obviously could not receive the gift if God had not accepted them, so he clearly had accepted them— even without circumcision
