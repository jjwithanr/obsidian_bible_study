#### v.38-39
>"Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. <sup>39</sup>Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses.

#### v.43
>When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.

#### v.46
>Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: "We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.

#### v.47
>For this is what the Lord has commanded us: " 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.' "

#### v.48
>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.

"All who were appointed \[GK 5435\] for eternal life believed" suggests that belief in Christ is not just a matter of one's faith but primarily involves divine appointment.
