## Overview:



#### v.3
>then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?

#### v.9
>Peter said to her, "How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also."

#### v.11
>Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.

This is the first use of the word **church** in the Book of Acts. “The Christian _ekklesia_ was both new and old – new, because of its relation and witness to Jesus as Lord and to the epoch-making events of his death exaltation and the sending of the Spirit; old, as the continuation of the ‘congregation of the Lord’ which had formerly been confined within the limits of one nation, but now, having died and risen with Christ, was to be open to all believers without distinction.” (Bruce)

#### v.13
>No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by te people.

The community of Christians had a marvelous reputation for integrity, and everybody knew it was a serious thing to be a follower of Jesus.
