# Acts 24

## Overview:


#### v.5
>"We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect

“Sect” is not a derogatory term in itself. The term was employed simply to designate various Greek philosophic schools and (by \*Josephus) various schools of thought in Judaism (such as \*Pharisees or \*Sadducees). “Nazarenes” (a term Jewish Christians in time generally applied to themselves) was perhaps originally an insult, calculated against the obscurity of Jesus’ hometown (cf. [Jn 1:46](John1#v.46)).

During his reign over Judea, Felix had repeatedly crucified the leaders of various uprisings and had killed many of their followers for disturbing the Pax Romana. Tertullus' endeavor, as supported by the high priest and the Jewish elders with him, was to put Paul on the same level as these brigands, with the hope that in his insensitivity to the issues, Felix would act in his usual manner simply on the basis of their testimony.

#### v.14
>However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,

#### v.15-16
>and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. <sup>16</sup>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.

See also [Titus 2:11-13](Titus2#v.11-13).

1/12/23 As the book of Proverbs has constantly reminded, make every effort to guard your heart and keep the end of all things in mind. Obey God's Word and fear God that I may receive wisdom from above. With a resurrection to come, my conscience has sufficient incentive to stay clear.

#### v.22
>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case."

#### v.25
>As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you."

Although wealthy households often sponsored philosophers to provide interesting insights at dinners or tutor family members, God’s prophets were less pleasant than most philosophers ([Jer 38:14-23](Jeremiah38#v.17)). Justice and self-control were among the favored topics of many moralists, but the future judgment was especially Jewish teaching and probably not the side of Jewish teaching the procurator was accustomed to hearing.

Yes, the poor prisoner, having nought wherewith to assist him in the delivery of the truth, but having everything to his disadvantage—the chain, the prison dress, the character of one that had stirred up sedition in a nation—this poor prisoner, with believing hand, laid hold on the sword of truth, and with this he did divide in sunder the joints and marrow. He did beard the lion in his den.

Even now I see him look the governor sternly in the face, attack him in his heart, drive him from his excuses, push the Word home at the point of the bayonet of truth, drive him from every refuge of lies, and make him tremble! O marvelous power of a preached Gospel! O mighty truth that God is with the ministry, when the kings of the earth that take counsel together are yet dismayed by it.

“It is wonderful,” said a good man once to a minister, “it is wonderful to see a whole congregation moved to tears by the preaching of the Word.” “Yes,” said that minister, “it is wonderful, but I know a wonder ten times greater than that—the wonder is that those people should so soon wipe away their tears and forget what they have heard.”
