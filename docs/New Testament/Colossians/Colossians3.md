# Colossians 3

## Overview:
After establishing the true nature of Christ and the riches of knowing Him, Paul lays out what a life lived worthy of such a manner looks like. His instructions aren't just mere rules and suggestions; rather, they're lifestyles inspired and breathed by the Holy Spirit.

#### v.1
>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

To set the heart (lit., "seek"; GK 2426) things above is to desire and to strive for heavenly things. It is to see to it that one's interests are constantly centered in Christ, that one's attitudes, ambitions, and whole outlook on life are molded by Christ's relationship to the believer, and that one's allegiance to him takes precedence over all earthly allegiances.

#### v.2
>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.

Since we are raised from the death of sin, and are made to live anew, the great object of our contemplation should be the heavenly world.
#barnes 

Setting the heart on things above (v.1) is descriptive of one's aim for the practical pursuit of the Christian life. Setting the mind (v.2) on things above refers more to one's inner disposition. There is, of course, an intimate connection between the two.
To set the mind on (lit., "think on"; GK 5858) things above has the connotation of giving heavenly things a large place in one's thought life—seeing to it that the governing tendency of thought and will is toward God.

#### v.3
>For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.

At the present time our connection with God and Christ is a matter of inner experience; one day it will come into full and open manifestation.

The sweetest part, if one may speak of one part being sweeter than another, is the _rest_ which full identification with Christ brings. 🔥**I am no longer anxious about anything, as I realise this; for He, I know, is able to carry out _His will_, and His will is mine. It makes no matter where He places me, or how. That is rather for Him to consider than for me; for in the easiest positions He must give me His grace, and in the most difficult His grace is sufficient.** It little matters to my servant whether I send him to buy a few cash worth of things, or the most expensive articles. In either case he looks to me for the money, and brings me his purchases. So, if God place me in great perplexity, must He not give me much guidance; in positions of great difficulty, much grace; in circumstances of great pressure and trial, much strength? No fear that His resources will be unequal to the emergency! And His resources are mine, for _He_ is mine, and is with me and dwells in me. All this springs from the believer's oneness with Christ. And since Christ has thus dwelt in my heart by faith, how happy I have been! I wish I could tell you, instead of writing about it.

#### v.5
>Put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.

Now we are charged to "put to death" (GK 3739; lit,. "to make dead") the old life in everyday practice. This verb suggests that we must not simply suppress or control evil acts and attitudes; rather, we are to wipe them out and completely exterminate the old way of life. The verb also suggests that we must do so in a vigorous, possibly painful act of personal determination (cf. the principle taught in [Mt 18:8-9](Matthew18#v.8-9)).

#### v.6
>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.

#### v.8
>But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.

The Christian must be very aware of the words that come out of their mouths. Speech and conduct is to be watched closely ([James 3:6](James3.md#v.6), [Proverbs 10:19](Proverbs10#v.19), etc.)

#### v.10
>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.

But especially had he that knowledge which is the fear of the Lord; that knowledge of God which is the result of love. Piety, in the Scriptures, is often represented as the "knowledge" of God; see the notes at [John 17:3](John17#v.3); compare the notes at [Ephesians 3:19](Ephesians3#v.19).

#### v.12
>Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.

This is how we become dressed in the white garments of [Revelation 3:5](Revelation3#v.5). Here's the secret: When we realized we're clothed in the very garments of Christ, our confidence level before God soars to the heavens. Satan's accusations cannot lodge within us, and they just bounce off our shield of faith. We are accepted by the Father, and now we can enjoy the peaceful dialogue of intimacy with Jesus. Hit with accusation? Get dressed!

"Humility" (GK 5425) and "gentleness" (GK 4559), which are related terms, were not considered virtues by the pagan world. The NT, however deepened and enriched their meanings and made them two of the noblest of Christian graces. Humility denotes a humble disposition (cf. [Php 2:4-8](Philippians2#v.4)). Gentleness is the opposite of pride and self-assertiveness and is the special mark of the one who has a delicate consideration for the rights and feeling of others. It is a characteristic of Christ ([Mt 11:29](Matthew11#v.28-30)), a fruit of the Spirit ([Gal 5:23](Galatians5#v.22-23)), and a distinctive trait of those who belong to Christ ([Mt 5:5](Matthew5#v.5)).

#### v.13
>Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

#### v.14
>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.

#### v.15
>Let the word of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.

Preside in your hearts; sit as umpire there (Doddridge); govern and control you. The word rendered here "rule" - βραβεύετω brabeuetō - is commonly used in reference to the Olympic and other games. It means, to be a director, or arbiter of the public games; to preside over them and preserve order, and to distribute the prizes to the victors. The meaning here is, that the peace which God gives to the soul is to be to us what the brabeutes, or governor at the games was to those who contended there. **It is to preside over and govern the mind; to preserve every thing in its place; and to save it from tumult, disorder, and irregularity.** The thought is a very beautiful one. The soul is liable to the agitations of passion and excitement - like an assembled multitude of men. It needs something to preside over it, and keep its various faculties in place and order; and nothing is so well fitted to do this as the calm peace which religion gives, a deep sense of the presence of God, the desire and the evidence of his friendship, the hope of his favor, and the belief that he has forgiven all our sins. **The "peace of God" will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul;** subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order - as a ruler sways and controls the passions of assembled multitudes of people.

#### v.16
>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.

Whereas [Ephesians 5:18-19](Ephesians5#v.18) emphasizes the Spirit in worship, Paul in Colossians is **concerned with erring persons who have not recognized the full sufficiency of Christ;** he thus emphasizes the “word of Christ” here.

We need sound theology when we worship God.

#### v.17
>And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

When I started using my phone during my internship, I got convicted that my work ethic isn't invisible to God in non-spiritual contexts. No, we are to do everything in the name of Jesus always giving thanks.
#jj struggle is real.

#### v.21
>Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.

The image is of an overbearing disciplinarian who constantly corrects and rebukes a child for every little mistake or perceived wrong. Such a father will provoke his children.  
The Greek word translated “discouraged” is found only here in the New Testament. It speaks of becoming disheartened or “losing spirit.” According to _A Handbook on Paul’s Letters to the Colossians and to Philemon_, such a discouraged child will close down his heart and hide inside himself. “The child feels that he can never do anything right and so gives up trying” (Bratcher, R., & Nida, E., United Bible Societies, 1993, p. 94).

They should not be so praised as to make them vain and proud, but they should be commended when they do well. The desire of praise should not be the principle from which they should be taught to act, but they should feel that the approbation of parents is a desirable thing, and when they act so as to deserve that approbation, no injury is done them by their understanding it. He who always finds fault with a child; who is never satisfied with what he does; who scolds and frets and complains, let him do as he will, breaks his spirit, and soon destroys in the delicate texture of his soul all desire of doing well. The child in despair soon gives over every effort to please. He becomes sullen, morose, stupid, and indifferent to all the motives that can be presented to him, and becomes to a great extent indifferent as to what he does - since all that he does meets with the same reception from the parent.
#barnes 

Lord, correct my view of you. I have often viewed you as a disciplinarian due to my awareness of how often I fall short. Father, fill me with your Holy Spirit that I may have the knowledge of your will.

#### v.23
>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,

#### v.25
>Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.

This is a more clear description of favoritism to God. It's not that He is unable to show favor but that He consistent in His judgements.

Doubtless Paul meant this as a warning to Christian slaves not to presume on their position before God and to think that he would overlook their misdeeds, even if they were acting unscrupulously because of being treated unfairly. In the parallel passage in Ephesians it is the master who is reminded that there is no partiality with God ([Eph 6:9](Ephesians6#v.9)).
