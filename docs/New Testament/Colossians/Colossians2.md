# Colossians 2

## Overview:
Paul's struggle for the church in Colossae is motivated by his desire for them to truly know Christ in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. This is very needed in their region where false teachings are rampant - especially asceticism.


#### v.2
>My purppose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,

#### v.3
>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.



#### v.20-23
>Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rule: <sup>21</sup>"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"? <sup>22</sup>These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup>23</sup>Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.

Ascetics cannot enjoy material possessions. While as Christians, we must be generous and ready to share, and not fix our hope on material things, Paul taught that God “richly supplies us with all things to enjoy” ([1 Tim. 6:17](1Timothy6#v.17)). Countering those who forbade marriage and advocated abstaining from certain foods, Paul said ([1 Tim. 4:4](1Timothy4#v.4-5)), “For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with gratitude.” Christians can rightly enjoy all of life under the lordship of Christ, including a good meal, the beauty of God’s creation, and the sexual relationship within marriage. Ascetics teach that such pleasurable enjoyment is wrong... **The ascetic is often trying to make himself acceptable to God through harsh treatment of the body.** By this he thinks he can atone for his sins or show enough contrition to merit God’s favor. But **Christian self-discipline operates from the platform of knowing that God has accepted us in Jesus Christ on the *basis of His grace*. The motive behind self-discipline is not to gain His favor, but to be pleasing to the Lord because He loved me and died for me.**
