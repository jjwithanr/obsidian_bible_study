# Colossians 4

## Overview:
Paul concludes his letter with a final instruction to the Colossians to keep praying and being wise in the way they treat outsiders. He mentions fellow brothers and sisters in the faith and all they've done for the Lord as well as their statuses.

#### v.1
>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.

#### v.2
>Devote yourself to prayer, being watchful and thankful.

#### v.5
>Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.

To "be wise in the way to you act toward outsiders" is to show practical Christian wisdom in dealing with secular society. Paul's words imply that believers are to be cautious and tactful as to avoid needlessly antagonizing or alienating their pagan neighbors. In a positive sense, these words also imply that believers should conduct themselves so that the way they live will attract, impress, and convict non-Christians and give the pagan community a favorable impression of the Gospel (see also 1Co 5:12-13; 1Th 4:12; 1Ti 3:7 for other passages where unbelievers are designated as "outsiders").

Good verse in rebuttal against "you belong before you believe". Unbelievers are outsiders.

#### v.6
>Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.

"Seasoned with salt" may mean that Christian conversation is to be marked by purity and wholesomeness. Some, however, understand "salt" in the sense of that which gives taste or flavor... Conversation must be appropriate for each person to whom we speak.

#### v.10-11
>My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.) <sup>11</sup>Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.

There is a note of pathos in Paul's remark about these three: "These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God." Paul felt keenly his alienation from his countrymen (cf. Ro 9:3; Php 1:15-17).

#### v.12
>Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that **you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.**

I've been praying this over Brandon and Irene since I read it.

Epaphras, mentioned in 1:7 as the founder of the Colossian church and as Paul's representative, is here described as "one of you" (cf. v.9) and as "a servant of Christ Jesus." Paul reminds the Colossians that Epaphras was continually "wrestling" (GK 76; cf. 1:29 for the same word) for them in his prayers. He was concerned that they stand firm, mature, and fully convinced in relation to everything God wills. Undoubtedly he had in mind the possibility of their wavering under the influence of the heretical teaching at Colosse.

#### v.14
>Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.

Of Luke, Paul says very little Interestingly enough, however, much of what we know about him is derived from this casual reference. It is here that we learn that Luke was a physician, and the context (cf. v.11) suggests that he was a Gentile.
