# Colossians 4

## Overview:
Paul concludes his letter with a final instruction to the Colossians to keep praying and being wise in the way they treat outsiders. He mentions fellow brothers and sisters in the faith and all they've done for the Lord as well as their statuses.

#### v.1
>Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.

#### v.2
>Devote yourself to prayer, being watchful and thankful.

#### v.6
>Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.


#### v.12
>Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that **you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.**

I've been praying this over Brandon and Irene since I read it.
