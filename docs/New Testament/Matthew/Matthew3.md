# Matthew 3

## Overview:


#### v.2
>and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."

First sermon in the New Testament is repentance.

#### v.6
>Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

Pagans wanting to convert to Judaism would repent and be baptized, but John here treats Jewish people on the same terms as pagans (see further comment on Mk 1:4-5.)

#### v.7
>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

John expresses his astonishment that sinners so hardened and so hypocritical as they were should have been induced to flee from coming wrath. The wrath to come means the divine indignation, or the punishment that will come on the guilty.

An ancient tradition suggested that some kinds of vipers ate their way out of their mothers (see, e.g., Herodotus, \*Plutarch). It was bad enough to be called a viper, but to be called a viper’s child was even worse—killing one’s mother or father was the most hideous crime conceivable in antiquity.

#### v.8
>Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.

The \*Pharisees themselves are known to have questioned professions of repentance if the supposedly repentant person continued sinning. The Old Testament prophets had sometimes described the obedience one owed God, or God’s future blessing of his people, in terms of fruit (a natural image in an agricultural society; cf. Is 5:2; 27:6; Hos 10:1, 12-13; 14:7-8; Prov 11:30-31).

Do not bring your cunning and dissimulation to this work; do not carry your hypocrisy into your professed repentance, but evince your sincerity by forsaking sin, and thus give evidence that this coming to Jordan to be baptized is not an act of dissimulation. No discourse could have been more appropriate or more cutting.

#### v.12
>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burnin up the chaff with unquenchable fire."

Because the same Greek (and Hebrew) word can mean both “spirit” and “wind,” the picture of wind and fire carries over from 3:11. Winnowing was familiar to all Palestinian Jews, especially to the farmers: they would throw harvested wheat into the air, and the wind would separate the heavier grain from the lighter chaff. The chaff was useless for consumption and was normally burned.

#### v.15
>Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.

He submitted to the ordinance of baptism, also, in order that occasion might be taken, at the commencement of his work, for God publicly to declare his approbation of him, and his solemn appointment to the **office of the Messiah.**

#### v.17
>And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."

Out of Christ, God is a consuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum of the gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.
