#### v.3
>And he said: "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Jesus first draws the analogy of a child to speak of kingdom entry, not kingdom greatness, which is what the disciples have asked about. This is a narrative clue that their question might not have been an appropriate one. If Jesus so redefines kingdom status that those of lowest status are to be emulated, then the question about who is greatest is utterly misguided.
Views of children were substantially different in the first-century world than in our contemporary Western context, so we are prone to import into this passage qualities of children as we perceive them. We might, for example, highlight the innocence of children, when in a first-century Greco-Roman context children were viewed as less reliable than adults, who had the full measure of logos or rational capacity. We might also emphasize that children are humble in attitude, as the language of Matthew 18:4 in some English versions suggests (e.g., “whoever becomes humble like this child” \[NRSV\]). Yet children are not necessarily humble in the sense of holding an attitude of selflessness. Instead, as we have seen above, children are an example in the first-century world of those with little status. As the NIV reads, “Whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” We can teach this text well by helping people to understand that they should renounce status preoccupation in favor of taking care of those most vulnerable and marginalized in the community of faith. This is the focus of Jesus’ message using the example of a child.

#### v.4
>Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus answers the disciples’ question about kingdom greatness by pointing to a child who has little status. The NIV’s “lowly position” reflects the Greek word tapeinoō, which can indicate internal disposition or external situation (BDAG 990). In this context, the latter is most likely. Jesus uses a child to demonstrate that the disciples are misguided in seeking greatness in the kingdom. They should instead assume the position of those who are lowest in status within the kingdom community (also 20:26–27).

#### v.8-9
>If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. <sup>9</sup>And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.

#### v.10
>"See that you do no look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.

#### v.17
>If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.

#### v.18
>"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

#### v.19-20
>"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. <sup>20</sup>For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."

This is connected with the previous verses. The connection is this: The obstinate man is to be excluded from the church, [Matthew 18:17](Matthew18#v.17). The care of the church - the power of admitting or excluding members - of organizing and establishing it - is committed to you, the apostles, [Matthew 18:18](Matthew18#v.18). Yet there is not need of the whole to give validity to the transaction. When two of you agree, or have the same mind, feelings, and opinion, **about the arrangement of affairs in the church**, or about things desired for its welfare, and shall ask of God, it shall be done for them. See [Acts 1:14-26](Acts1); [Acts 15:1-29](Acts15). **The promise here has respect to the apostles in organizing the church.** It cannot with any propriety be applied to the ordinary prayers of believers. Other promises are made to them, and it is true that the prayer of faith will be answered, but that is not the truth taught here.

>"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart."

Lord, help me to be quick in forgiving.
