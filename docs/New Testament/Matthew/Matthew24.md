# Matthew 24

## Overview:


#### v.6
>You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.

#### v.10
>At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,

#### v.12-13
>Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, <sup>13</sup>but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.

Set your face as flint. It is the one who stands firm who will persevere. Not the one who stands tall with their shoulders back in every season. The one who stands firm. It's must easier to stand firmly when your foundation itself doesn't shake when everything else does. Be a doer of the word with and without an increase of wickedness.

#### v.14
>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

The gospel is testimony to all nations. It proclaims the universal sinfulness of mankind and claims to have the answer to the most dire need of the human soul. It is for everyone.
#jj 

#### v.26-27
>"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. <sup>27</sup>For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

#### v.35
>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

God's promises are inherently more trustworthy than earthly promises - simply because the earth is temporary but God isn't.
#jj 

#### v.44
>So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
