#### v.30
>At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like angels in heaven.

#### v.31-32
>But about the resurrection of the deadâ€”have you not read what God said to you, <sup>32</sup>'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dad but of the living."

If God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob even while he was addressing Moses hundreds of years after the first three patriarchs died, then they  must be alive to him. God is the eternal God of the covenant, a fact especially stressed wherever reference is made to the patriarchs (e.g., [Ge 24:12](Genesis24#v.12), [27](Genesis24#v.27), [48](Genesis24#v.48); [26:24](Genesis26#v.24); [28:13](Genesis28#v.13)). He always loves and blesses his people; therefore it is inconceivable that his blessings cease when his people die (cf. [Pss 16:10-11](Psalm16#v.11); [17:15](Psalm17#v.15); [49:14-15](Psalm49.md#v.14-15); [73:23-26](Psalm73#v.23)).
At first glance, [Ex 3:6](Exodus3#v.5-6) is sufficient to prove immortality but not resurrection. But the Sadducees denied the existence of spirits as thoroughly as they denied the existence of angels ([Ac 23:8](Acts23#v.8)). Their concern was not to choose between immortality and resurrection but between death as finality and life beyond death, whatever its mode. Jesus' point is that God will raise the dead as the one who always keeps his promise to be their God.
