# Matthew 13

## Overview:



#### v.44
>"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.

When a person sees it and hears it, it is his duty to sacrifice all that hinders his obtaining it, and to seek it with the earnestness with which other people seek for gold. The truth often lies buried: it is like rich veins of ore in the sacred Scriptures; it must be searched out with diligence, and its discovery will repay a man for all his sacrifices, [Luke 14:33](https://biblehub.com/luke/14-33.htm); [Philippians 3:8](https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm).

#### v.52
>He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out his storeroom new treasures as well as old."

The truth, new or old, which you have gained, keep it not laid up and hid, but bring it forth, in due season and on proper occasions, to benefit others. Every preacher should be properly instructed.

#### v.58
>And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

Unbelief is the great hinderance to Christ's favours.

We are not to suppose that his power was limited by the belief or unbelief of people; but they were so "prejudiced," so set against him, that they were not in a condition to "judge of evidence" and to be convinced. They would have charged it to derangement, or sorcery, or the agency of the devil.

And when there is little true belief, and prayer is cold and formal, there the people sleep in spiritual death and are unblessed.
