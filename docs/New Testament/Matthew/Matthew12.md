# Matthew 12

## Overview:



#### v.6
>I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.

#### v.11-12
>He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? <sup>12</sup>How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."

The Father's heart; as swift as our fall is His grasp of the outreached hand. Notice it is when the sheep is in a pit - not when it is walking up a tough hill to follow its Shepherd. Jesus does not lift us out of situations uphills that train our spiritual muscles and build character. Rather, He's the one who leads us down such paths but He is mighty to save whenever we fall into a pit and become once again for a Savior to deliver us.
