# Matthew 28

## Overview:


#### v.3
>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.

#### v.8
>So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

#### v.10
>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

#### v.17
>When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.

#### v.18-20
>Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <sup>19</sup>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sup>20</sup>and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

The reference point for "everything" commanded by Jesus is not made explicit in this passage or even in Matthew elsewhere. Yet the implied reader of Matthew is fairly sure that "everything" primarily focuses on the five great teaching discourses of Matthew's Gospel. Matthew organizes most of Jesus' teaching into these five discourses ( chaps. 5-7, 10, 13, 18, and 24-25). Together these discourses build to the climactic ending of the fifth and final discourse ([25:31-46](Matthew25)). In [28:17-20](Matthew28#v.18-20), the content implied in "everything" seems focused in this direction.
