# Matthew 6

## Overview:



#### v.1
>"Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

Judaism stressed that one should not perform deeds for the sake of reward but nonetheless promised reward, as Jesus does here; this reward is rendered at the day of judgment, as in Judaism. Prayer, fasting and gifts to the poor were among the basic components of Jewish piety (Tobit 12:8), and many \*rabbis listed qualities (e.g., virtues on which the world was founded) in sets of three

#### v.4
>so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

#### v.6
>But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

It is taken for granted that all who are disciples of Christ pray. You may as soon find a living man that does not breathe, as a living Christian that does not pray. If prayerless, then graceless. The Scribes and Pharisees were guilty of two great faults in prayer, vain-glory and vain repetitions.

#### v.7
>And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.

And how greatly do they err who measure prayers by the yard. They think they have prayed so much because they have prayed so long, whereas **it is the work of the heart**—the true pouring out of the desire before God—that is the thing to be looked at. Quality not quantity, truth, not length. Oftentimes the shortest prayers have the most prayer in them.

You've silenced the majority of the body of Christ.

Healthy criticism on prayer movement / Contend. "Dialing down" more general prayer meetings can help the majority of the body of Christ feel they can meaningfully participate in corporate prayer without shouting their throats off.

#### v.15
>But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

#### v.17-18
>But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, <sup>18</sup>so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

The meaning of this whole commandment is, when you regard it to be your duty to fast, do it as a thing expressing deep feeling or sorrow for sin, not by assuming unfelt gravity and moroseness, but in your ordinary dress and appearance; not to attract attention, but as an expression of feeling toward God, and he will approve and reward it.

Self-denial is practiced in secret. It is done quietly and exclusively for God, to be seen by His eyes alone. When practiced in purity before our loving Father, self-denial serves to awaken the flow of life in the secret place.

#### v.19-20
>"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. <sup>20</sup>But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break and steal.

Do not exhaust your strength and spend your days in providing for the life here, but let your chief anxiety be to be prepared for eternity. Compare the notes at [Isaiah 55:2](Isaiah55#v.2). In heaven nothing corrupts; nothing terminates; no enemies plunder or destroy. To have treasure in heaven is to possess evidence that its purity and joys will be ours. It is to be heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, [1 Peter 1:4](1Peter1#v.4-5). The heart, or affections, will of course be fixed on the treasure. To regulate the heart, it is therefore important that the treasure, or object of attachment, should be right.
#barnes 

#### v.21
>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

You will find people form a pretty accurate estimate of the value of their own religion by the proportion which they are prepared to sacrifice for it.
