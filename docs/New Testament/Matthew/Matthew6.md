# Matthew 6

## Overview:

#### v.7
>And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.

And how greatly do they err who measure prayers by the yard. They think they have prayed so much because they have prayed so long, whereas it is the work of the heart—the true pouring out of the desire before God—that is the thing to be looked at. Quality not quantity, truth, not length. Oftentimes the shortest prayers have the most prayer in them.
