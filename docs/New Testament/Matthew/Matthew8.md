# Matthew 8

## Overview:


#### v.2-3
>A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."

This was an exhibition of great faith, and also an acknowledgment of his dependence on the will of Jesus, in order to be healed. So every sinner must come. He must feel that Jesus "can" save him.

The rawest expression of combining faith with expectation is inquiring of God's willingness. I know You are able and You can, but are You willing? It simply confesses we are utterly at the mercies of God.

#### v.8
>The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

#### v.10
>When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.

We should concern ourselves for the souls of our children and servants, who are spiritually sick, who feel not spiritual evils, who know not that which is spiritually good; and we should bring them to Christ by faith and prayers. Observe his self-abasement. Humble souls are made more humble by Christ's gracious dealings with them. Observe his great faith. The more diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in Christ.
