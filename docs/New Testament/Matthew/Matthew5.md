We are rich in terms of our legal position before God. But, in terms of our living conditions, we are poor.

Those who have been brought low enough to be humble enough to be ready to receive.

You could decide that you were going to be friends with what you knew or you could friends with what you didn't know. If you're friends with what you know, you try to prove your point all the time.

Jung said, "Modern men do not see God because they do not look low enough."

#### v.4
>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

[[edward]]

Those that mourn thus shall be comforted. So those that grieve over sin; that sorrow that they have committed it, and are afflicted and wounded that they have offended God, shall find comfort in the gospel.

#### v.5
>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

Meekness produces peace. It is proof of true greatness of soul. It comes from a heart too great to be moved by little insults. It looks upon those who offer them with pity. He that is constantly ruffled; that suffers every little insult or injury to throw him off his guard and to raise a storm of passion within, is at the mercy of every mortal that chooses to disturb him. He is like "the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."

#### v.6
>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

Those who are perishing for want of righteousness; those who feel that they are lost sinners and strongly desire to be holy, shall be thus satisfied. Never was there a desire to be holy which God was not willing to gratify, and the gospel of Christ has made provision to satisfy all who truly desire to be holy.
#barnes 

God promises to fill every holy desire He starts within us through the Holy Spirit.

Although I loved the poetry of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, I remained oblivious to its truth. People who already feel righteous don’t hunger and thirst for it.

#### v.7
>Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

#### v.8
>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

#### v.9
>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.

#### v.13
>"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.

a rabbi at the end of the first century. When asked how one could make saltless salt salty again, he replied that one should salt it with the afterbirth of a mule. Being sterile, mules have no afterbirth, and the rabbi was saying that those who ask a stupid question receive a stupid answer. Real salt does not lose its saltiness; but if it did, what would you do to restore its salty flavor—salt it? Unsalty salt was worthless

#### v.14
>"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.

#### v.17
>"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

#### v.18
>I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

#### v.19
>Anyone who breaks the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Inequality exists in heaven.
#jj 

#### v.20
>For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Phraisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus sets the stage for why we need God to impute His righteousness onto us.

#### v.22
>But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgement. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

When excited against sin, it is lawful. God is angry with the wicked, [Psalm 7:11](Psalm7.md#v.11). Jesus looked on the hypocritical Pharisees with anger, [Mark 3:5](Mark3#v.5). So it is said, "Be ye angry, and sin not, [Ephesians 4:26](Ephesians4#v.26). This anger, or indignation against sin, is not what our Saviour speaks of here. What he condemns here is anger without a cause; that is, unjustly, rashly, hastily, where no offence has been given or intended. In that case it is evil; and it is a violation of the sixth commandment, because "he that hateth his brother, is a murderer," [1 John 3:15](1John3#v.15). He has a feeling which would lead him to commit murder, if it were fully acted out. The word "brother" here refers not merely to one to whom we are nearly related, having the same parent or parents, as the word is commonly used, but includes also a neighbor, or perhaps anyone with whom we may be associated. As all people are descended from one Father and are all the creatures of the same God, so they are all brethren: and so every man should be regarded and treated as a brother, [Hebrews 11:16](Hebrews11#v.16).

\[Raca\] comes from a verb signifying to be empty, vain; and hence, as a word of **contempt**, denotes senseless, stupid, shallow-brains. Jesus teaches here that to use such words is a violation of the spirit of the sixth commandment, and if indulged, may lead to a more open and dreadful infraction of that law. Children should learn that to use such words is highly offensive to God, for we must give an account for every idle word which we speak in the day of judgment, [Matthew 12:36](Matthew12#v.36).

#### v.23-24
>"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember your brother has something against you, <sup>24</sup>leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.

 So now the worship of God will not be acceptable, however well performed externally, until we are at peace with those that we have injured. "To obey is better than sacrifice," [1 Samuel 15:22](1Samuel15#v.22). He that comes to worship his Maker filled with malice, and hatred, and envy, and at war with his brethren, is a hypocritical worshipper, and must meet with God's displeasure. God is not deceived, and he will not be mocked.

#### v.28
>But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

The Greek word here is the same as in the opening line of the tenth commandment in the \*Septuagint (the Greek version of the \*Old Testament): “You shall not desire your neighbor’s wife” ([Ex 20:17](Exodus20.md#v.17)). The tenth commandment, against coveting, forces Jesus’ hearers to internalize Moses’ other commandments.

#### v.29-30
>If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup>30</sup>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

The idea is, that **the dearest earthly objects are to be sacrificed rather than that we should commit sin;** that the most rigid self-denial should be practiced, and that the most absolute self-government should be maintained at any sacrifice, rather than that we should suffer the mind to be polluted by unholy thoughts and impure desires.

#### v.32
>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.


#### v.34
>But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne;

If lies were not so common, oaths would be needless. And oaths increase the evil from which they come, by confirming the notion that there is no sin in a lie unless it is sworn to.
#maclaren 

#### v.35
>or by the earth, for it his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.

#### v.36
>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.

#### v.37
>Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.

#### v.39
>But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

As a judicial rule it is not unjust. Christ finds no fault with the rule as applied to magistrates, and does not take upon himself to repeal it. But instead of confining it to magistrates, the Jews had extended it to private conduct, and made it the rule by which to take revenge. They considered themselves justified by this rule to inflict the same injury on others that they had received.
#barnes

#### v.42
>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

It is good to be in the habit of giving. At the same time, the rule must be interpreted so as to be consistent with our duty to our families [1 Timothy 5:8](1Timothy5#v.8) and with other objects of justice and charity. It is seldom, perhaps never, good to give to a person who is able to work, [2 Thessalonians 3:10](2Thess3#v.10). To give to such is to encourage laziness, and to support the idle at the expense of the industrious. If such a one is indeed hungry, feed him; if he needs anything further, give him employment. If a widow, an orphan, a man of misfortune, or an infirmed man, lame, or sick, is at your door, never send any of them away empty. See [Hebrews 13:2](Hebrews13#v.2); [Matthew 25:35-45](Matthew25#v.43).

#### v.44-45
>But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup>45</sup>that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

Theologians refer to God's goodness to everyone, no matter who they are, as "common grace." Jesus has described His disciples as the "light of the world" ([Matthew 5:14–16](Matthew5#v.14)). God is the source of the light in His people... Believers attract people to faith in Christ when they give good in exchange for evil, and when they pray for those who bring them pain.

#### v.48
>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Applied to people, it refers to completeness of parts, or perfection, where no part is defective or wanting. Thus, [Job 1:1](Job1#v.1) is said to be "perfect;" that is, not holy as God, or "sinless" - for fault is afterward found with him [Job 9:20](Job9#v.20); [Job 42:6](Job42.md#v.6); but his piety was "proportionate" - had a completeness of parts was consistent and regular. He exhibited his religion as a prince, a father, an individual, a benefactor of the poor. **He was not merely a pious man in one place, but uniformly. He was consistent everywhere.** See the notes at that passage. This is the meaning in Matthew. Be not religious merely in loving your friends and neighbors, but let your piety be shown in loving your enemies; imitate God; let your piety be "complete, proportionate, regular." This every Christian may be; this every Christian must be.
