We are rich in terms of our legal position before God. But, in terms of our living conditions, we are poor.

#### v.4
>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

[[edward]]

Those that mourn thus shall be comforted. So those that grieve over sin; that sorrow that they have committed it, and are afflicted and wounded that they have offended God, shall find comfort in the gospel.

#### v.5
>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

Meekness produces peace. It is proof of true greatness of soul. It comes from a heart too great to be moved by little insults. It looks upon those who offer them with pity. He that is constantly ruffled; that suffers every little insult or injury to throw him off his guard and to raise a storm of passion within, is at the mercy of every mortal that chooses to disturb him. He is like "the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."

#### v.6
>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

Those who are perishing for want of righteousness; those who feel that they are lost sinners and strongly desire to be holy, shall be thus satisfied. Never was there a desire to be holy which God was not willing to gratify, and the gospel of Christ has made provision to satisfy all who truly desire to be holy.

God promises to fill every holy desire He starts within us through our regeneration from the Holy Spirit.

#### v.7
>Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

#### v.8
>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

#### v.9
>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.

#### v.13
>"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.

a rabbi at the end of the first century. When asked how one could make saltless salt salty again, he replied that one should salt it with the afterbirth of a mule. Being sterile, mules have no afterbirth, and the rabbi was saying that those who ask a stupid question receive a stupid answer. Real salt does not lose its saltiness; but if it did, what would you do to restore its salty flavorâ€”salt it? Unsalty salt was worthless

#### v.17
>"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

#### v.18
>I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

#### v.19
>Anyone who breaks the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

Inequality exists in heaven.

#### v.20
>For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Phraisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus sets the stage for why we need God to impute His righteousness onto us.
