#### v.4
>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

[[edward]]

Those that mourn thus shall be comforted. So those that grieve over sin; that sorrow that they have committed it, and are afflicted and wounded that they have offended God, shall find comfort in the gospel.

#### v.5
>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

Meekness produces peace. It is proof of true greatness of soul. It comes from a heart too great to be moved by little insults. It looks upon those who offer them with pity. He that is constantly ruffled; that suffers every little insult or injury to throw him off his guard and to raise a storm of passion within, is at the mercy of every mortal that chooses to disturb him. He is like "the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."

#### v.6
>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

Those who are perishing for want of righteousness; those who feel that they are lost sinners and strongly desire to be holy, shall be thus satisfied. Never was there a desire to be holy which God was not willing to gratify, and the gospel of Christ has made provision to satisfy all who truly desire to be holy.
#barnes 

God promises to fill every holy desire He starts within us through our regeneration from the Holy Spirit.
