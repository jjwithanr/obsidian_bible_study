# Matthew 25

## Overview:


#### v.9
>“ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’

#### v.13
>“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

#### v.15
>To one he gave five talents of monry, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

#### v.21
>“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

#### v.26
>“His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?

The servant who merely buried his talent tried to excuse himself because of his master’s great power. In fact, he believed his master to be in some sense omnipotent: **reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed**.

i. **A hard man**: “Grasping, ungenerous, taking all to himself, offering no inducements to his servants.” (Bruce)

ii. F.B. Meyer expressed the thinking of this servant: “I can do very little; it will not make much difference if I do nothing: I shall not be missed; my tiny push is not needed to turn the scale.”

iii. “It is the genius of wicked men to lay the blame of their miscarriages upon others, oftentimes upon God himself.” (Poole)
