# Matthew 7

## Overview:


#### v.1-2
>"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. <sup>2</sup>For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

This may be the most often-misused verse in the entire Bible. Modern culture garbles this comment into a command to never disapprove or correct the actions of another. This mishandling of Christ's words is out of context _three times over_. First and foremost, **Christ does not say "never judge,"** He warns that there is a consequence to judgment. Second, this statement is immediately followed by instructions from Christ on the proper way to use judgment. Third, Jesus' other teachings explicitly indicate that **right judgment is necessary** (John 7:24), while hypocritical or shallow judgment is wrong.

#### v.6
>"Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.

We are not to expose the gospel of Jesus Christ to those who have no other purpose than to trample it and return to their own evil ways. Repeatedly sharing the gospel with someone who continually scoffs and ridicules Christ is like casting pearls before swine.

#### v.7
>"Ask and it will be give to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.

Prayer is the appointed means for obtaining what we need. Pray; pray often; **make a business of prayer**, and be serious and earnest in it. Ask, as a beggar asks alms. Ask, as a traveller asks the way. Seek, as for a thing of value that we have lost; or as the merchantman that seeks goodly pearls. Knock, as he that desires to enter into the house knocks at the door. **Sin has shut and barred the door against us; by prayer we knock.** Whatever you pray for, according to the promise, shall be given you, if God see it fit for you, and what would you have more?

#### v.12
>So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

#### v.15
>"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

#### v.19
>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

#### v.21
>"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

#### v.24
>"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.


These two builders seem to have been *equally well skilled in architecture*. The one could build a house without receiving any more instruction than the other. I do not find that there was halt or pause on the part of either because he could not turn an arch, or fix a truss. Evidently they were both skilled workmen, well acquainted with their art. So is it with many here. **They know as far as the theory goes what the plan of salvation is, as well as I do.** Yet where the knowledge is the same, the ultimate result may vary, two men may be equally well instructed in the Scriptures, yet one of them may be wise and the other foolish.

Knowledge puffs up, love alone builds up. My dear friends, I am most earnest that those of you who are desiring to find everlasting life in Christ Jesus, may not be content with anything short of a true, deep, and real work of grace in your hearts, for no clearness of head knowledge, no natural earnestness of purpose or eagerness of desire can save you, without an interest in Christ Jesus you are lost to all eternity.

#### v.29
>because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
