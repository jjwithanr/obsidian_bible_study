# Matthew 26

## Overview:


#### v.8-9
>When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked. <sup>9</sup>"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."

#### v.13
>I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."

#### v.28
>This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

Was not your blood poured out for many? Was it not poured out for [[edward]]? Lord, bring him home!

#### v.31
>Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: " 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'

Jesus used the term "fall away" outside of the context of forfeiting their salvation. Were the disciples saved at this point? Judas?

#### v.42-43
>He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."

#### v.44
>So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
