# Matthew 9

## Overview:


#### v.4
>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?

#### v.13
>But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."

The sense in which our Saviour applies it is this: "You Pharisees are exceedingly tenacious of the "external" duties of religion; but God has declared that he prefers benevolence or mercy to those external duties. It is proper, therefore, that I should associate with sinners for the purpose of doing them good."
