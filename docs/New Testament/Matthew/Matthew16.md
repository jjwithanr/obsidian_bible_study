# Matthew 16

## Overview:


#### v.4
>A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away.

#### v.9
>Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 

#### v.12
>Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeest used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

#### v.16
>Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

The disciples have seen Jesus for who He truly is. Wonder begets intimate knowledge.

#### v.23
>Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."

#### v.24
>Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

If you can receive it, here's the secret: Self-denial can serve as a catalyst to help propel you forward into greater joys of intimacy in the secret place. Self-denial and intimacy go hand in hand.

#### v.27
>For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.

#### v.28
>I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
