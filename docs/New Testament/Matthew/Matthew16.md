# Matthew 16

## Overview:


#### v.1
>The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. 

#### v.2-3
>He replied, "When evening comes, and you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' <sup>3</sup>and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.

These \[signs of the times\] testify to Jesus and the kingdom now dawning (cf. [11:4-6](Matthew11#v.4); [12:28](Matthew12#v.28)). The proof that they cannot discern the signs is simply that they ask for a sign (v.1)!

#### v.4
>A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away.

#### v.9
>Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? 

#### v.12
>Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeest used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

#### v.16
>Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

The disciples have seen Jesus for who He truly is. Wonder begets intimate knowledge.

#### v.23
>Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."

#### v.24
>Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

If you can receive it, here's the secret: Self-denial can serve as a catalyst to help propel you forward into greater joys of intimacy in the secret place. Self-denial and intimacy go hand in hand.

#### v.25
>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.

#### v.26
>What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?

#### v.27
>For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.

#### v.28
>I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
