# Matthew 17

## Overview:


#### v.5
>While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"

This was spoken to confirm the disciples; to make known to them that it was their duty to hear Christ rather than any other, and to honor him more than Moses and Elijah; and to strengthen their faith in him when they should go forth to preach the gospel after he was shamefully put to death.

#### v.7
>But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."

#### v.20
>He replied, "Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ,'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

Part of the lesson here is the potency of genuine faith. In giving this reminder, Christ once again mentions the tiny mustard seed as a metaphor for living, active faith ([Matthew 13:31â€“32](Matthew13#v.31-32)).

#### v.22-23
>When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. <sup>23</sup>They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life." And the disciples were filled with grief.

#### v.27
>"But so that we may not offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."

That is, lest they should think that we despise the temple and its service, and thus provoke needless opposition; though we are not under obligation to pay it, yet it is best to pay it to them.
