# Matthew 15

## Overview:


#### v.13
>He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.

Religious doctrine is not inaptly compared to a plant. See [1 Corinthians 3:6-8](http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm). It is planted in the mind for the purpose of producing fruit in the life, or right conduct. Jesus here says that all those doctrines of which his Father was not the author must be rooted up or corrected.

#### v.19
>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.

#### v.28
>Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed from that every hour.

#### v.32
>Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."

#### v.34
>"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked.

How much are you able to give me? He was not measuring the amount loaves to determine how many he can multiply. Jesus does not require perfection in outcome and results. He requires a total heart devotion and for us to give Him everything.
