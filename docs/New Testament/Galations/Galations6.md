# Galations 6

## Overview:



#### v.1
>Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritiual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you may also be tempted.

Forgiveness is different from restoration.
#mikewinger 

#### v.2
>Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

#### v.3
>If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.

#### v.4
>Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,

Here is the true secret of happiness. It consists:

(1) **in not forming an improper estimate of ourselves;** in knowing just what we are, and what is due to us; in not thinking ourselves to be something, when we are nothing.

(2) **in leading such a life that it may be examined to the core, that we may know exactly what we are without being distressed or pained.** That is, in having a good conscience, and in the honest and faithful discharge of our duty to God and man.

(3) **in not being dependent on the fickle applause of the world for our comfort.** The man who has no internal resources, and **who has no approving conscience**; who is happy only when others smile, and miserable when they frown, is a man who can have no security for enjoyment. The man who has a good conscience, and who enjoys the favor of God, and the hope of heaven, carries with him the source of perpetual joy. He cannot be deprived of it. His purse may be taken, and his house robbed, but the highwayman cannot rob him of his comforts. He carries with him an unfailing source of happiness when abroad, and the same source of happiness abides with him at home; he bears it into society, and it remains with him in solitude; it is his companion when in health, and when surrounded by his friends, and it is no less his companion when his friends leave him, and when he lies upon a bed of death.

#### v.5
>for each one should carry his own load.

**I. There are burdens which can be shared, and there are burdens which _cannot_.**  
  
Let us take the case from which the whole context has arisen. Paul was exhorting the Galatians, as I explained, in reference to their duty to a fallen brother; and he speaks of him--according to our version--as ‘overtaken in a fault.’ Now, that is scarcely his idea, I think. The phrase, as it stands in our Bibles, suggests that Paul is trying to minimise the gravity of the man’s offence; but just in proportion as he minimised its gravity would he weaken his exhortation to restore him. **But what he is really doing is not to make as little as possible of the sin, but to make as much of it as is consistent with the truth.**

We have come across people who chiefly show their own purity by their harsh condemnation of others’ sins. One has heard of women so very virtuous that they would rather hound a fallen sister to death than try to restore her; and there are saints so extremely saintly that they will not touch the leper to heal him, for fear of their own hands being ceremonially defiled. Paul says, ‘Bear ye one another’s burdens’; and especially take a lift of each other’s sin.

**There is the awful burden of personal existence.** It is a solemn thing to be able to say ‘I.’ And that carries with it this, that after all sympathy, after all nestling closeness of affection, after the tenderest exhibition of identity of feeling, and of swift godlike readiness to help, each of us lives alone. 

Then again, **there is the burden of responsibility** which can be shared by none.

And then, closely connected with responsibility there is another--**the burden of the inevitable consequences of transgression**, not only away yonder in the future, when all human bonds of companionship shall be broken, and each man shall ‘give account of himself to God,’ but here and now; as in the immediate context the Apostle tells us, ‘Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.’ The effects of our evil deeds come back to roost; and they never make a mistake as to where they should alight.

I rejoice as much as any man in the largely increased sense of mutual responsibility and obligation of mutual aid, which is sweetening society by degrees amongst us to-day, but I believe that **no Socialistic or other schemes for the regeneration of society which are not based on the Incarnation and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ will live and grow**. There is but one power that will cast out natural selfishness, and that is love to Christ, apprehending His Cross as the great example to which our lives are to be conformed. I believe that the growing sense of brotherhood amongst us, even where it is not consciously connected with any faith in Christianity, is, to a very large extent, the result of the diffusion through society of the spirit of Christianity, even where its body is rejected.

The design of this passage is, to **prevent people from forming an improper estimate of themselves**, and of the opinions of others. Let a man feel that he is soon to stand at the judgment-seat, and it will do much to keep him from an improper estimate of his own importance; let him feel that he must give an account to God, and that his great interests are to be determined by the estimate which God will affix to his character, and it will teach him that the opinion of the world is of little value. This will restrain his vanity and ambition. This will show him that **the great business of life is to secure the favor of God,** and to be prepared to give up his account; and there is no way so effectual of checking ambition, and subduing vanity and the love of applause, as to feel that we are soon to stand at the awesome bar of God.

#### v.6
>Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.

I have often wondered why all the apostles reiterated this request with such embarrassing frequency… We have come to understand why it is so necessary to repeat the admonition of this verse. When Satan cannot suppress the preaching of the Gospel by force, he tries to accomplish his purpose by striking the ministers of the Gospel with poverty.

#### v.7-8
>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. <sup>8</sup>The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.

How many long prayers are offered; how much zeal is shown; how many warm professions are made, as if to make God and man believe that the heart was truly engaged in the cause of religion, **while little or nothing is given in the cause of benevolence**; while the ministers of religion are suffered to starve; and while the "loud professor" rolls in wealth, and is distinguished for luxury of living, for gaiety of apparel, for splendor of equipage, and for extravagance in parties of pleasure! Such professors attempt to mock God.

#### v.9
>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. This we should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance in well-doing is the reward promised.

#### v.10
>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

Luther said that justification was the article of a standing or a falling church. That may be true in the region of theology, but in the region of practical life I do not know that you will find a test more reliable and more easy of application than this, Does a man care for spreading amongst his fellows the gospel that he himself has received? If he does not, let him ask himself whether, in any real sense, he has it.

We have awful responsibilities; the world is open to us. We have the highest good. **How shall we obey this elementary principle of our text, unless we help as we can in spreading Christ’s reign?** Blessed shall we be if, and only if, we fill the seed-time with delightful work, and remember that well-doing is imperfect unless it includes doing good to others, and that the best good we can do is to impart the Unspeakable Gift to the men that need it.

#### v.12
>Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.

It is not from any true love for the cause of religion. It is, that they may avoid persecution from the Jews. If they should renounce the doctrine which taught that circumcision was indispensable, they would be exposed to the rage of the Jews, and would suffer persecution. Rather than do this, they make a show of great, zeal in inducing others to be circumcised.
#barnes 

Approving circumcision out of fear of spite from their Jewish brethren was the epitome of virtue signaling mixed with fear of man in the first century's religious scene.

#### v.14
>May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

It was a glorious Saviour who died; it was glorious love that led him to die; it was a glorious object to redeem a world; and is is unspeakable glory to which he will raise lost and ruined sinners by his death. O who would not glory in such a Saviour! Compared with this, what trifles are all the objects in which people usually boast! And what a lesson is here furnished to the true Christian! Let us not boast of our wealth. It will soon leave us, or we shall be taken from it, and it can aid us little in the great matters that are before us. It will not ward off disease; it will not enable us to bear pain; it will not smooth the couch of death; it will not save the soul. Let us not glory in our strength, for it will soon fail; in our beauty, for we shall soon be undistinguished in the corruptions of the tomb; in our accomplishments, for they will not save us; in our learning, for it is not that by which we can be brought to heaven. But let us glory that we have for a Saviour the eternal Son of God - that glorious Being who was adored by the inhabitants of heaven; who made the worlds; who is pure, and lovely, and most holy; and who has undertaken our cause and died to save us. **I desire no higher honor than to be saved by the Son of God. It is the exaltation of my nature, and shows me more than anything else its true dignity, that one so great and glorious sought my redemption.** That cannot be an object of temporary value which he sought by coming from heaven, and if there is any object of real magnitude in this world, it is the soul which the eternal Son of God died to redeem.

#### v.15
>Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.
