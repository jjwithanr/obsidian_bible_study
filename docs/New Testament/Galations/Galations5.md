# Galations5

## Overview:


#### v.1
>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.

#### v.5
>But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope.

#### v.6
>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor noncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.

A mere intellectual assent to the truth may leave the heart cold and unaffected; mere orthodoxy, however bold and self-confident, and "sound," may not be inconsistent with contentions, and strifes, and logomachies, and divisions. The true faith is that which is seen in benevolence, in love to God, in love to all who bear the Christian name; in a readiness to do good to all mankind. This shows that the heart is affected by the faith that is held; and this is the nature and design of all genuine religion. Tyndale renders this, "faith, which by love is mighty in operation."
