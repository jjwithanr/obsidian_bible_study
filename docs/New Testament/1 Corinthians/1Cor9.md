# 1 Corinthians 9

## Overview:



#### v.15
>But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive ome of this boast.

If he did not accept the calling as a voluntary privilege, he would have to fulfill it nonetheless (cf. Ex 4:10–17), yet without reward (1 Cor 9:16–17). But he would “rather die” than relinquish this privilege and reward (9:15), a graphic expression to underline the point (cf. Rom 9:3). Ancients often claimed that death (or not being born, Matt 26:24) was preferable to some lamentable situation; this was common in Jewish, Greek, and Roman sources. One could use the expression rhetorically, but more often it indicated severe emotional intensity,

#### v.16
>Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do no preach the gospel!

Lord, help me be a better relational evangelist. Give me boldness and grace to preach the gospel to my senior design team: Christina, Darren, and Matthew. I want to obey you and preach your gospel! Help me, Lord. 2/28/2022

#### v.17
>If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.

#### v.18
>What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.

Paradoxically, this reward appears to be the sacrificial life itself, so that he might share the gospel’s fruit, namely “gaining” many for Christ (9:19–23; NRSV uses “win”). He would sacrifice his profit so others could profit with salvation (10:33). One who offered service voluntarily was “free” (Xenophon Cyr. 8.1.4; Philostratus Hrk. 30.3).
