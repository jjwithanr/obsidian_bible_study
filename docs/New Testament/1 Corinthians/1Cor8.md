# 1 Corinthians 8

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs, but love builds up.

Knowledge is that act of passing from a state of unconscious ignorance to a state of conscious ignorance.

Thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot. Every man who will not have softening of the heart must at least have softening of the brain.

#### v.3
>But the man who loves God is known by God.

With the essential ingredient of love, knowledge is tempered and made the right kind of discerning and compassionate knowledge exhibited when one loves god. In loving God, a person shows that he is known by God—**that God recognizes him as his own and that he had the right kind of knowledge, because he is exercising it in love to his fellow Christians and to God.**

#### v.12
>When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
