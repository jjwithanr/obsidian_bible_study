# 1 Corinthians 8

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Now about food sacrified to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs, but love builds up.

Knowledge is that act of passing from a state of unconscious ignorance to a state of conscious ignorance.

Thinking in isolation and with pride ends in being an idiot. Every man who will not have softening of the heart msut at least have softening of the brain.

#### v.3
>But the man who loves God is known by God.

#### v.12
>When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
