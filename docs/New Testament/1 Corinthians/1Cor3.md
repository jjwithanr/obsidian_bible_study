# 1 Corinthians 3

## Overview:


#### v.1
>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly—mere infants in Christ.

#### v.2
>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.

#### v.3
>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?

#### v.4
>For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men?

#### v.6-7
>I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. <sup>7</sup>So neither he who plants or he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.

#### v.12-13
>If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, <sup>13</sup>his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.

Very easy to build up a church quickly. Very easy to make a great excitement in religion, and become very famous as a soul-winner. Very easy. But time tries everything. If there were no other fire than the mere fire of time, it would suffice to test a man’s work. And when a church crumbles away almost as soon as it is got together, when a church declines from the doctrines which it professed to hold, when the teaching of the eminent teacher is proved, after all, to have been fallacious and to have been erroneous in practical results, then what he has built comes to nothing!

#### v.16
>Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?

#### v.21-22
>So then, **no more boasting about men!** All things are yours, <sup>22</sup>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—**all are yours**,

If a man has everything, he has no need to glory in some one little thing. If a man has only one gold ring, you will see him wearing it on his finger every day, and putting his hand in such a position that everybody may see it, but he who has far more, need not be particular about just one ring being seen. Does the Queen care that other people shall know what plate and jewels she has at Windsor? Everybody knows that she is rich, that she has an abundance, and therefore it is not necessary that she should display a portion of it. **Whenever you find a person glorying in some little thing, you may be sure he is acting contrary to what he should be.**

Do not be boasting then, about one thing when all things are yours. The little child, when it has a present, shows it to every person who comes into the house, but when the child becomes a man, he shows not everything that he has, yet he has more possessions than he had before. Thus the worldling may glory in his riches, and boast of his strength, but Christians, you are too far advanced for this, you are too wise, “for all things are yours,” and surely you will not attach undue importance to one.

A key to humility and dying to areas where Pride puffs up is remembering that there is no need to assert we are better/superior since all things are ours in Christ Jesus.
