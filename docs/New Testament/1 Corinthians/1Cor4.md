# 1 Corinthians 4

## Overview:


#### v.5
>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.

#### v.9
>For it seems to me that God put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men.
