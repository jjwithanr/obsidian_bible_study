## Overview:


#### v.7

#### v.9
>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

#### v.20
>Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him.

#### v.28
>But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.

#### v.32
