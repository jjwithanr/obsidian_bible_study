# 1 Corinthians 7

## Overview:


#### v.7
>I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.

#### v.9
>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

#### v.10
>To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.

#### v.12
>To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.

It can hardly be doubted his instruction in 1 Corinthians 7:10-11 is based on the teaching of Jesus preserved for us in [Mark 10:2-12](Mark10). But for the question of what is to be done when a believer is married to a nonbeliever, Paul was not in possession of a direct teaching from Jesus. Jesus did not address this issue during his ministry. Thus, after appealing to the direct teaching of Jesus regarding the sanctity of marriage as intended by the Creator, Paul goes on, after simply acknowledging that he does not have another direct word from the Lord, to apply the implications of that divine intention to the complex situation of marriage between believers and unbelievers. The thrust of the passage makes it difficult, if not impossible, to assume that Paul intended his words to convey a lessened sense of authority.

>But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.
