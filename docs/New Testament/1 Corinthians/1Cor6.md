# 1 Corinthians 6

## Overview:


#### v.1
>If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?

#### v.2-3
>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? <sup>3</sup>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!

#### v.4
>Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church!

#### v.5
>I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?

#### v.6
>But instead, one brother goes to law against another--and this in front of unbelievers!

#### v.7
>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?

#### v.8
>Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers.
