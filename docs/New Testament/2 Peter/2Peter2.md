# 2 Peter 2

## Overview:
Peter condemns false teachers.

#### v.4
>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;

#### v.12
>But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.

They have no spirit.

#### v.19
>They promise them freedom, while they themsleves are slaves of depravity - for a man is slave to whatever has mastered him.

Similar to [Romans 6:16](Romans6#v.16).

#### v.20-21
>If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. <sup>21</sup>It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.

#### v.22
>Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud."

The passage would seem to imply, that whatever pains should be taken to change the habits of the dog, he would return to them again.

In other words, these people were never truly changed in their nature. Dogs and pigs do what dogs and pigs do. Those truly in Christ don't merely get rid of the sin in their lives and, thus, become acceptable to God. Through faith and by God's power, true believers are changed in their very nature, becoming more and more like Jesus over time through the power of God at work in them. This does not mean perfection, but it does mean a changed life. Those who show evidence that they were never changed, it stands to reason, are still exactly what they used to be.
