# Jude

## Overview:
Jude feels urged to warn Christians of the false teachers among them and their characteristics.


#### v.1
>Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James,
>To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ.

See also [1 Peter 1:5](1Peter1#v.5). The meaning is, that they **owed their preservation wholly to him;** and if they were brought to everlasting life, it would be only by him. What the apostle here says of those to whom he wrote, is true of all Christians. They would all fall away and perish if it were not for the grace of God keeping them.

#### v.4
>For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who **change the grace of our God into a license for immorality** and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.

#### v.8
>In the very same way, these **dreamers** pollute their own bodies, reject authority and slander celestial beings.

The Greek word (ἐνυπνιάζω enupniazō) means to dream; and is applied to these persons as holding doctrines and opinions which sustained the same relation to truth which dreams do to good sense. Their doctrines were the fruits of mere imagination, foolish vagaries and fancies.

Big dreams does not qualify a ministry. Jude calls the false teachers dreamers since their theology were founded upon a revelation apart from Christ's testimony. A dream remains a dream when it resides in our own psyche. The ones who dreamed in [Psalm 126](Psalm126.md) were captives who returned to Zion and filled with joy for all **what the Lord has done - NOT what their dreams had done.**

#### v.9
>But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"

Significantly, Michael **dared not bring against him a reviling accusation**. Michael did not mock or accuse the devil. God hasn’t called us to judge the devil, to condemn the devil, to mock him or accuse him, but to battle against him in the name of the Lord.

#### v.12
>These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, **caring for themselves**; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted;

There is a regular ascent in this climax. First, the apostle sees a tree apparently of autumn, stripped and leafless; then he sees it to be a tree that bears no fruit; then he sees it to be a tree over which successive winters and summers pass and no signs of life appear; then as wholly extirpated. So he says it is with these men. They produce no fruits of holiness; months and years show that there is no vitality in them; they are fit only to be extirpated and cast away. Alas! how many professors of religion are there, and how many religious teachers, who answer to this description!

#### v.16
>These men are **grumblers and faultfinders**; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.

Grumbling “is to insult the God who gives us all things; it is to forget that whatever befalls us, nothing can separate us from His love, nor deprive us of that most priceless of all treasures, the Lord’s presence in our lives.” (Green)

Nothing is more common than for men to complain of their lot; to think that it is hard; to **compare theirs with that of others**, and to **blame God for not having made their circumstances different.** The poor complain that they are not rich like others; the sick that they are not well; the enslaved that they are not free; the bereaved that they are deprived of friends; the ugly that they are not beautiful; those in humble life that their lot was not cast among the great and the frivolous. The virtue that is opposed to this is “contentment” - a virtue of inestimable value. See the notes at [Philippians 4:11](Philippians4#v.11).

Showing great respect to certain persons, particularly the rich and the great. The idea is, that they were not “just” in the esteem which they had for others, or that they did not appreciate them according to their real worth, but paid special attention to one class in order to promote their selfish ends.

#### v.19
>These are the men who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.

**Not having the Spirit**: This same description could be written over many churches, or church projects, or evangelism campaigns, or home groups, or even individual Christian lives. The church and the world truly need genuinely _spiritual_ men and women today. 😓

#### v.20
>But you, dear friends, **build yourselves up** in your most holy faith and **pray in the Holy Spirit.**

It is said here that they were to “build up themselves;” that is, they were to act as moral and responsible agents in this, or were to put forth their own proper exertions to do it. Dependent, as we are, and as all persons with correct views will feel themselves to be, yet it is proper to endeavor to do the work of religion as if we had ample power of ourselves
#barnes 

**Faith is the foundation of all supreme excellence and nobility and beauty of character**; because, for one thing, it dethrones self, and enthrones God in our hearts; making Him our aim and our law and our supreme good; and because, for another thing, our trust brings us into direct union with Him, so that we receive from Him the power thus to build up a character.

#### v.21
>Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.

The perspective isn’t, “I’m so great that _even_ God loves me,” but **"God is so great that He loves _even_ me."**

#### v.22
>Be merciful to those who doubt,

The class here referred to, to whom “pity” (ἐλεάτε eleate) was to be shown, and in whose conversion and salvation tender compassion was to be employed, appear to have been the timid, the gentle, the unwary; those who had not yet fallen into dangerous errors, but who might be exposed to them; those, for there are such, **who would be more likely to be influenced by kind words and a gentle manner than by denunciation**. The direction then amounts to this, that while we are to seek to save all, we are to adapt ourselves wisely to the character and circumstances of those whom we seek to save.

#### v.23
>snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with fear - hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.

While we endeavor to save the “sinner,” we cannot too deeply loathe his “sins;” and in approaching some classes of sinners **there is need of as much care to avoid being defiled by them**, as there would be to escape the plague if we had any transaction with one who had it. Not a few have been deeply corrupted in their attempts to reform the polluted.

#### v.24
>To him who is able to **keep you from falling** and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy

Keeping us spiritually safe _is_ God’s work. But you can always tell the people He is working in, because _they_ are working also. God doesn’t call us to simply let the Christian life happen to us and He doesn’t command us to save ourselves. He calls us to a partnership with Him.
#enduringword 

It is wise to look round on the dangers and evils that tempt; it is wise to look inward to the weaknesses that may yield to the temptations. But every look on surrounding dangers, and every look at personal weakness, **ought to end in a look upwards** ‘ to Him that is able to keep’ the weakest ‘from falling’ before the assaults of the strongest foes.
So our highest praise, and our deepest thankfulness, ought to arise, and will arise-if the possibility has become, in any measure, an actuality, in ourselves-to Him, because our experience will be that of the Psalmist who sang, ['When I said, my foot slippeth, Thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.''](Psalm94.md#v.18) Let us take the comfort of believing, ['He shall not fall, for the Lord is able to make him stand'](Romans14#v.4); and let us remember the expansion which another Apostle gives us when, with precision, he discriminates and says, ['Kept by the power of God through faith, unto salvation.'](1Peter1#v.4-5)

With every breath I long to follow Jesus  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
And day by day I know He will renew me  
Until I stand with joy before the throne
