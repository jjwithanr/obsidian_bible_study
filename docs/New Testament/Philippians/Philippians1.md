# Philippians 1

## Overview:


#### v.3
>I thank my God every time I remember you.

What a blessing it is have people in your life that can evoke a thankfulness and gratitude to the Lord whenever you think of them! Do others thank God when they remember me? Or does it stir envy, bitterness, and hesitation due to the unbridled way I live?

#### v.5
>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,

To commend a child when he does well, may be as important, and as much a duty, as to rebuke him when he does ill. God is as careful to commend his people when they do well, as he is to rebuke them when they do wrong - and that parent, teacher, or pastor, has much mistaken the path of wisdom, who supposes it to be his duty always to find fault.

The term translated “participation” (nasb) or “partnership” (niv) was often used in an economic sense for those who “share” (cf. nrsv) monetarily. Here it includes the financial help the Philippians have given (4:10-20).

#### v.6
>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

#### v.7
>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defeding and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.

#### v.8
>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.

Paul regarded them with something of the affection which the Lord Jesus had for them. This was the tenderest and strongest expression which he could find to denote the ardor of his attachment.
#barnes 

This is the goal for a minister of Christ: to love God's people with the affection of Christ Jesus. We can only share in God's love for His people if, indeed, we share in His anguish for the salvation of their souls.
#jj 

#### v.9-10
>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, <sup>10</sup>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,

The idea is, that he wished them to have intelligent affection...he wished their religion to be intelligent and discriminating; to be based on knowledge, and a proper sense of the relative value of objects, as well as to be the tender affection of the heart.

#### v.11
>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.

Paul ends this section of encouragement with a particular goal. He wants to see the Philippian believers overflowing with the results of a Christ-filled life. For as generous and giving as they had been (Philippians 1:5), there were even greater levels of blessing available to them. These are not blessings "paid for" by good works, but the personal, spiritual benefits associated with Godly living. Paul will mention "righteousness" three more times in this letter (Philippians 3:6, 9). True righteousness comes not from works, but from God, and depends on faith (Philippians 3:9).

#### v.14
>Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.

Jewish teachers allowed that serving God from impure motives was better than not serving him at all. They also unequivocally insisted, however, that those who used the \*law only for their own gain would not share in the world to come.

#### v.15
>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.

It would seem most probable, though this is not mentioned, that these persons were Judaizing teachers, professing Christianity, and who supposed that Paul's views were derogatory to the honor of Moses and the Law.
#barnes 

#### v.17
>The former preach Christ out of **selfish ambition**, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.

The sense is, that he was appointed to be a defender of the gospel, and that they being well convinced of this, went forth to promulgate and defend the truth. That fact was one of Paul's chief consolations while he was thus in confinement.
#barnes 

#### v.18
>But what does it matter? The imnportant thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.

It would be better to have preachers that were better instructed, or that were more prudent, or that had purer motives, or that held a more perfect system, yet it is much in our world to have the name of the Redeemer announced in any way, and even to be told, in the most stammering manner, and from whatever motives, that man has a Saviour. **The announcement of that fact in any way may save a soul; but ignorance of it could save none.**
#barnes 

#### v.21
>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

These words are also important when discussing what happens to a believer's soul upon death. Some have argued that "soul sleep" is possible. This is the view that the believer's soul enters a state of unawareness, and does not go to heaven with the Lord until the future judgment. This verse shows the false nature of this teaching. Paul clearly states his expectation to be with Christ the moment his life on earth ends. This is a view also reflected by Jesus when He told the thief on the cross he would be in paradise with Him "today" (Luke 23:43).
#bibleref 

#### v.26
>so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.

#### v.27
>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel

Paul is calling on his readers to live out unity, in one spirit and mind, working together "for the faith of the gospel." His goal continually remained on the gospel and its spread.
#bibleref 

#### v.29
> For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe onhim, but also to **suffer** for him.

It is a privilege thus to suffer in the cause of Christ:

(1) because we then resemble the Lord Jesus, and are united with him in trials;

(2) because we have evidence that we are his, if trials come upon us in his cause;

(3) because we are engaged in a good cause, and the privilege of maintaining such a cause is worth much of suffering; and,

(4) because it will be connected with a brighter crown and more exalted honor in heaven.
#barnes 

His readers had likely already faced some persecution, and may have wondered why they had to suffer if they were faithfully living for God. Paul makes it clear that godliness and suffering often go together. There are times when we suffer, at the hands of the world, because we are following the will of God. The world hates the gospel, and it will naturally try to stamp it out (John 16:1–4). Second Timothy 3:12 says, "Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
