# Philippians 1

## Overview:


#### v.7
>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defeding and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.


#### v.9-10
>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, <sup>10</sup>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,


#### v.17
>The former preach Christ out of **selfish ambition**, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.

#### v.18
>But what does it matter? The imnportant thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.

#### v.21
>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.


#### v.29
> For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe onhim, but also to **suffer** for him.
