# Philippians 1

## Overview:


#### v.3
>I thank my God every time I remember you.

What a blessing it is have people in your life that can evoke a thankfulness and gratitude to the Lord whenever you think of them! Do others thank God when they remember me? Or does it stir envy, bitterness, and hesitation due to the unbridled way I live?

#### v.5
>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,

To commend a child when he does well, may be as important, and as much a duty, as to rebuke him when he does ill. God is as careful to commend his people when they do well, as he is to rebuke them when they do wrong - and that parent, teacher, or pastor, has much mistaken the path of wisdom, who supposes it to be his duty always to find fault.

The term translated “participation” (nasb) or “partnership” (niv) was often used in an economic sense for those who “share” (cf. nrsv) monetarily. Here it includes the financial help the Philippians have given (4:10-20).

#### v.6
>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

#### v.7
>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defeding and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.

#### v.8
>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.

Paul regarded them with something of the affection which the Lord Jesus had for them. This was the tenderest and strongest expression which he could find to denote the ardor of his attachment.

This is the goal for a minister of Christ: to love God's people with the affection of Christ Jesus. We can only share in God's love for His people if, indeed, we share in His anguish for the salvation of their souls.

#### v.9-10
>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, <sup>10</sup>so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,

The idea is, that he wished them to have intelligent affection...he wished their religion to be intelligent and discriminating; to be based on knowledge, and a proper sense of the relative value of objects, as well as to be the tender affection of the heart.

#### v.11
>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.

Paul ends this section of encouragement with a particular goal. He wants to see the Philippian believers overflowing with the results of a Christ-filled life. For as generous and giving as they had been (Philippians 1:5), there were even greater levels of blessing available to them. These are not blessings "paid for" by good works, but the personal, spiritual benefits associated with Godly living. Paul will mention "righteousness" three more times in this letter (Philippians 3:6, 9). True righteousness comes not from works, but from God, and depends on faith (Philippians 3:9).

#### v.17
>The former preach Christ out of **selfish ambition**, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.

#### v.18
>But what does it matter? The imnportant thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.

#### v.21
>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.


#### v.29
> For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe onhim, but also to **suffer** for him.
