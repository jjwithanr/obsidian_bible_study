# Luke 22

## Overview:


#### v.15
>And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

#### v.25-26
>Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. <sup>26</sup>But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.

#### v.27
>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.

#### v.32
>But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."

#### v.36
>He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.

#### v.40
>On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."

#### v.45
>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.

#### v.61
>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."

In telling how the Lord looked at peter (v.61), Luke uses the same word John used (Jn 1:42) to describe the way Jesus looked at Peter when they first met. It was a look of love and concern.
