# Luke 19

## Overview:


#### v.11
>While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.

#### v.12-14
>He said: "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return. <sup>13</sup>So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.' <sup>14</sup>"But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'

The historical background for the parable was the visit of Archelaus, son of Herod the Great, to Rome to secure permission to reign as a so-called client king over a Roman territory. This petition was opposed by a delegation of Archelaus's own subjects. Similarly, Jesus has gone to the heavenly seat of authority till the time for his return. In the meantime, he has been rejected by those who should serveh im as his subjects (v.14).
