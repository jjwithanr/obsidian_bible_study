# Luke 21

## Overview:


#### v.4
>All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."

#### v.9
>When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."

#### v.12-13
>"But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. <sup>13</sup>This will result in your being witnesses to them.

#### v.14
>But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.

#### v.15
>For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.

#### v.19
>For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.

#### v.24
>They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

This verse implies that an extended period of time is needed for its fulfillmentâ€”an idea consistent with Luke's twofold emphasis on a period of waiting along with an expectation of Christ's imminent return. It also implies an end to the period when Gentiles are prominent in God's plan (cf. Ro 11:11-27).

#### v.28
>When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."

#### v.32
>"I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.

The other major alternative, "generation" as a class or race of people, makes most sense if it is understood as meaning the Jewish people. The point then is that the Jewish people will be preserved throughout the ages until the consummation of history at Christ's return.

#### v.33
>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

#### v.34
>"Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap.

#### v.36
>Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."
