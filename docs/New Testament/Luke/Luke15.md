# Luke 15

## Overview:


#### v.4
>"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?

#### v.7
>"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?

#### v.9-10
>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.' <sup>10</sup>In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

#### v.14-15
>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. <sup>15</sup>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.

#### v.17
>"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!

#### v.20
>So he got up and went to his father. "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.

#### v.28-29
>"The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. <sup>29</sup>But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.

The older brother was angry perhaps because his pride insisted he be celebrated for his merit rather share in his brother's celebration. This subtle pride of selfish ambition has been so exposing for me. Lord, help rid me of my selfish ambition. I am so insistent of self glory and so self-seeking 7/20/23.
