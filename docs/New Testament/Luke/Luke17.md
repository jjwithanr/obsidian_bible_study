# Luke 17

## Overview:



#### v.5-6
>The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!" <sup>6</sup>He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.

This was the disciple's response to Jesus' high call for them to be generous in forgiving those who sin against them. Yet, when the disciples recognize their great lack in faith to forgive, Jesus does not demand such great degree of faith from His disciples; he desires sincere faith. The smallest faith, as long as it is sincere, can do accomplish great things as it is already.
