#### v.3
>We ought always to thank God for you, brothers, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.

Paul thanks God for a local church that ever grows in their faith and love for Christ. God judges His church on these two pillars. Will He find faith when He returns (Luke 18:8)? And do they love one another (1 John 2:9-11)?

#### v.4
>Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your persevearance and faith in all persecution and trials you are enduring.

God boasts of a church that withstands the enemies' schemes to discourage and deceit God's children to sin.
#jj 

#### v.5
>All this is evidence that God's judgement is right and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.

The general sense seems to be, that the fact that they were thus persecuted was an evidence that there would be a future judgment, when the righteous who were persecuted would be rewarded, and the wicked who persecuted them would be punished.

The crimes of the wicked who go unpunished on the earth, and the sufferings of the good who are unavenged, are a demonstration that there will be a judgment, when all these inequalities will be adjusted.

#### v.6-7
>God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you <sup>7</sup>and to give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.

#### v.8
>He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

#### v.9
>They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power

Anti-annihilationist?

#### v.10
>on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you because you believed our testimony to you.

A people who anchor their hope in Jesus' return and grow in the knowledge of Him will still be marveled at His appearing. No amount of time, knowledge, and revelation can keep God's people from marveling at Jesus. **Jesus never gets old because he can't.**
#jj 

#### v.11
>To this end also we pray for you always, that our God will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill all your good pleasure for goodness and the work of faith with power,
