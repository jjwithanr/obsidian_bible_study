# Ephesians 6

## Overview:


#### v.4
>Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.

(Greek and Roman society was even harsher on newborn children; because an infant was accepted as a legal person only when the father officially recognized it, babies could be abandoned or, if deformed, killed. Early Christians and Jews unanimously opposed both abortion and abandonment. This text, however, addresses the discipline of minors in the household.)

#### v.6
>Obey them not only to win their favor when their is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.

We render acceptable service to God when, from regard to his will, we perform the services which are demanded of us in the situation in life where we may be placed, however humble that may be.

#### v.7-8
>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, <sup>8</sup>because you know what the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.

#### v.12
>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

#### v.16
>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

Because the Greek and Roman god of passion (called Eros and Cupid, respectively) was said to strike with flaming arrows, some of Paulâ€™s readers may have thought specifically of the temptation of sexual desire in this verse, although Paul probably intended the image to cover more than that danger (cf. Ps 11:2; 57:4; 58:3-7; 64:3; perhaps 120:1-4; Prov 25:18).
