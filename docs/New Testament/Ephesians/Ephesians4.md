# Ephesians 4

## Overview:

#### v.1
>As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.

Prisoners have forfeited all their rights. Christians have no rights outside of our identity in Christ. How illogical it is for a prisoner to cry out for rights! He has forfeited it all as a penalty for his sins. Yet, in Christ we have freedom from sin and are now slaves to Christ.

#### v.2
>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient bearing with one another in love.

Niagara excites our wonder; and we stand amazed at the power and greatness of God there, as he "pours it from his hollow hand." But one Niagara is enough for a continent or a world; while that same world needs thousands and tens of thousands of silver fountains, and gently flowing rivulets, that shall water every farm, and every meadow, and every garden, and that shall flow on, every day and every night, with their gentle and quiet beauty. So with the acts of our lives. It is not by great deeds only, like those of Howard - not by great sufferings only, like those of the martyrs - that good is to be done; **it is by the daily and quiet virtues of life** - the Christian temper, the meek forbearance, the spirit of forgiveness in the husband, the wife, the father, the mother, the brother, the sister, the friend, the neighbor - that good is to be done; and in this all may be useful.

#### v.3
>Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

#### v.14
>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.

So many persons are in regard to religious doctrines. They have no fixed views and principles. They hold no doctrines that are settled in their minds by careful and patient examination, and the consequence is, that **they yield to every new opinion, and submit to the guidance of every new teacher.** The "doctrine" taught here is, that **we should have settled religious opinions.** We should carefully examine what is truth, and having found it, should adhere to it, and not yield on the coming of every new teacher. We should not, indeed, close our minds against conviction. **We should be open to argument, and be willing to follow "the truth" wherever it will lead us.** But this state of mind is not inconsistent with having settled opinions, and with being firm in holding them until we are convinced that we are wrong. No man can be useful who has not settled principles. No one who has not such principles can inspire confidence or be happy, and the first aim of every young convert should be to acquire settled views of the truth, and to become firmly grounded in the doctrines of the gospel.

#### v.15
>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.

#### v.18
>They were darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.

Nothing is more obvious than that **indulgence in sin weakens the mental powers**, and **renders them unfit for high intellectual effort.** This is seen all over the pagan world now - in the stolid, stupid mind; the perverted moral sense; the incapacity for profound or protracted mental effort, as really as it was among the pagans to whom Paul preached.

He who wishes a mind well balanced and clear, should fear and love God; and had Christianity done no other good on earth than to elevate the "intellect" of mankind, it would have been the richest blessing which has ever been vouchsafed to the race.

**the way to elevate the understandings of mankind is to purify the heart.** The approach must be made through the affections. **Let people "feel" right toward God, and they will soon "think" right; let the heart be pure, and the understanding will be clear.**

#### v.19
>Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.

See also [Romans 1:24](Romans1#v.24).

#### v.28
> He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.

See more in [[wealth,work#Barnes on Ephesians 4 28 Ephesians4 v 28]].

#### v.29
>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

**We build others up not according to their deeds but according to their needs.** If true prayer is born out of need, every community ought to be in prayer together to best meet the needs of others around them. This verse points out that those who can't be benefitted are those who will not listen which we know is because of their igonrance of God due to the hardening of their hearts.

#### v.30
>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

That Divine Spirit pleads with us, and proffers its gifts to us, and turns away-I was going to use too strong a word, perhaps-sick at heart, not because of wounded authority, but **because of wounded love and baffled desire to help**, when we, in spite of It, will take our own way, neglect the call that warns us of our peril, and leave untouched the gifts that would have made us safe.
#barnes

The only way the Holy Spirit can be wounded is not because of any weakness He possesses. It is because of the love He possesses for those whom He is sealed inside. Wounded love comes from real love.

#### v.31
>Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.

Rage is defined as _passion_-driven behavior, i.e. actions emerging out of _strong impulses_ (intense emotion).

Anger's root, "_Orgē_ comes from the verb _oragō_ meaning, 'to teem, to _swell_'; and thus implies that it is not a sudden outburst, but rather (referring to God's) _fixed_, controlled, passionate feeling against sin . . . a _settled_ indignation (so Hendriksen)" (D. E. Hiebert, at 1 Thes 1:10).

#### v.32
>Instead, be kind to one another, tender-hearted, graciously forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has graciously forgiven you.

His courtesy is to be the result of love, good-will, and a desire of the happiness of all others; and this will prompt to the kind of conduct that will render his conversation. with others agreeable and profitable.
