# Ephesians 3

## Overview:



#### v.6
>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.

#### v.8
>Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,

But while Paul was thus thankful for his office, his success in it greatly humbled him. **The fuller a vessel becomes the deeper it sinks in the water.** A plenitude of grace is a cure for pride.

Preachers ought to grow in grace, for their very calling places them at a great advantage, since they are bound to search the Scriptures, and to be much in prayer. It is a choice mercy to be permitted to preach the gospel. I wish some of you would be ambitious of it, for earnest preachers are wanted.

I am bold to tell you that my Master’s riches of grace are so unsearchable, that he delights to forgive and forget enormous sin; the bigger the sin the more glory to his grace. If you are over head and ears in debt, he is rich enough to discharge your liabilities. If you are at the very gates of hell, he is able to pluck you from the jaws of destruction.

#### v.10
>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

Paul's implication is that God's wisdom is becoming known, even among angels of the spiritual realm, as a result of what is taking place through the church... This also means angelic beings are not omniscient; they can learn and grow in wisdom.

And, lastly, what think some of you, would angels say of _your_ walk and conversation? Well, I suppose you don’t care much about them, and yet you should. For who but angels will be the reapers at the last, and who but they shall be the convoy to our spirits across the last dark stream?

#### v.12
>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.

#### v.13
>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.

I struggled so much with discouragement while leading house church and house of prayer. Attedance and engagement were low. The fruit wasn't tangible. I would fuss over how any of my weaknesses in leadership hindered the night from being more engaging. But when I see Christ's suffering, I hear his command to not lose heart. Trials and tribulations are part of sanctification: I just needed to be steadfast and sow in spirit for at the proper time we will reap a harvest **if we do not give up**.
