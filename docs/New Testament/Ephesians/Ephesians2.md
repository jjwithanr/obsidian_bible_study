# Ephesians 2

## Overview:


#### v.1
>As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,

We were all once dead, but now alive (see [Luke 15:31-32](Luke15#v.31-32)).
#jj 

#### v.2
>in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.

He makes them to be his forge. There he blows his coals, there he fabricates his instruments. Do you not hear the noise of the infernal bellows when “the children of disobedience” swear, and use unclean language? Ah, such were some of us, but we are cleansed! The evil spirit has been driven out, and he no more works in us.

#### v.3
>All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath.

Holy Scripture is not complimentary to unrenewed human nature. You may search it through and through to find a single flattering word to unregenerate man, but you will search in vain. This style of speech is left to those who scout divine inspiration. They draw their inspiration from another fount, from a desire to walk according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air. They can use flattering speeches in addressing the ungodly, but the Holy Ghost never does.

#### v.4-5
>But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, <sup>5</sup>made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.

#### v.6
>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,

#### v.7
>in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.

See how Paul’s language grows and swells and rises as he proceeds! Just now, we read of “God, who is rich in mercy,” now the apostle speaks of “the exceeding riches of his grace,” exceeding expression, exceeding comprehension, exceeding even sin itself, though that is all but infinite. “The exceeding riches of his grace” are infinity itself, but they all come to us “through Christ Jesus.” Paul will speak of nothing good except that which comes “through Christ Jesus.” This is the one conduit pipe through which the streams of living water flow to the dead in sin, God’s grace comes to us “through Christ Jesus,” and through him alone.

#### v.8-9
>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— <sup>9</sup>not by works, so that no one can boast.

Men are justified by grace through faith in Christ Jesus. All the enmity of natural men is against that truth. They want to be saved by their own morality, and all sorts of things that they put instead of salvation by grace through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.

#### v.10
>For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

This is the great objective of our election, we are elected that we may be holy, and ordained that we may walk in good works—who can rightly quarrel with such a divine purpose as this?
#spurgeon 

#### v.13
>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

#### v.14
>For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,

Peace is found in a person, not a situation.
#jj 

See also [[Isaiah9#v 6]].

#### v.15
>by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,

This is the verse David Campbell uses to explain where Paul says the ritual and ceremonial aspects of the Mosaic law are done away with in the New Covenant. It cannot be the entire law since Paul later refers to Deuteronomy in chapter 6 for obeying your parents.

#### v.18
>For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.

Defense for trinity?
#jj 

All three persons of the Trinity are involved in the process of salvation. Salvation is found in Jesus, who gives us the Spirit to live within us, who grants access to the Father. All three persons operate at the same time in unique ways, yet are all identified as one and the same God

#### v.20
>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.

#### v.22
>And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
