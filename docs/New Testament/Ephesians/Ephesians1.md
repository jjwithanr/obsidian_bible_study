# Ephesians 1

## Overview:



#### v.
>

#### v.17
>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.

#### v.18
>I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be englightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,

Faith-the reliance of the spirit upon the veracity of the revealing God-gives hope its contents; for the **Christian hope is not spun out of your own imaginations**, nor is it the mere making objective in a future life of the unfulfilled desires of this disappointing present, but it is the recognition by the trusting spirit of the great and starry truths that are flashed upon it by the Word of God. **Faith draws back the curtain, and Hope gazes into the supernal abysses.** My hope, if it be anything else than the veriest will-o’-the-wisp and delusion, is the answer of my heart to the revealed truth of God.

Do you ever pray-I do not mean in words, but in real desire-that God would help you to keep steadily before you that great future to which we are all going so fast? If you do you will get the answer. **Seek for that Spirit**; use it, and do not resist its touches. Do not fix your gaze on the world when God is trying to draw you to fix it upon Himself. **Think more about Jesus Christ**, more about God’s high calling, live nearer to Him, and try more honestly, more earnestly, more prayerfully, more habitually, even amidst all the troubles and difficulties and trivialities of each day, to cultivate that great faculty of joyful and assured hope.
