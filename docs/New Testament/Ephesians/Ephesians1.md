#### v.3
>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.

God blesses us by gifts; we bless Him by words. The aim of His act of blessing is to evoke in our hearts the love that praises. We receive first, and then, moved by His mercies, we give. Our highest response to His most precious gifts is that we shall ‘take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord,’ and in the depth of thankful and recipient hearts shall say, ‘Blessed be God who hath blessed us.’

That is to say, he calls them ‘spiritual,’ not because they are, unlike material and outward blessings, gifts for the inner man, the true self, but **because they are imparted to the waiting spirit by that Divine Spirit** who communicates to men all the most precious things of God. They are ‘spiritual’ because the Holy Spirit is the medium of communication by which they reach men’s spirits.

‘In heavenly places.’ Now that does not merely define the region of origin, the locality where they originated or whence they come. It does do that, but it does a great deal more. It does not merely tell us, as we often are disposed to think that it does, that ‘every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down’-though that is perfectly true, but it means much rather that in order to get the gift we must go up. They are in the heavenly places, and they cannot live anywhere else

#### v.4-5
>For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love <sup>5</sup> he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—

#### v.7
>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace

#### v.13-14
>And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, <sup>14</sup>who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.

#### v.15
>For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,

#### v.16
>I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.

#### v.17
>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.

#### v.18
>I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,

Faith-the reliance of the spirit upon the veracity of the revealing God-gives hope its contents; for the **Christian hope is not spun out of your own imaginations**, nor is it the mere making objective in a future life of the unfulfilled desires of this disappointing present, but it is the recognition by the trusting spirit of the great and starry truths that are flashed upon it by the Word of God. **Faith draws back the curtain, and Hope gazes into the supernal abysses.** My hope, if it be anything else than the veriest will-o’-the-wisp and delusion, is the answer of my heart to the revealed truth of God.

Do you ever pray-I do not mean in words, but in real desire-that God would help you to keep steadily before you that great future to which we are all going so fast? If you do you will get the answer. **Seek for that Spirit**; use it, and do not resist its touches. Do not fix your gaze on the world when God is trying to draw you to fix it upon Himself. **Think more about Jesus Christ**, more about God’s high calling, live nearer to Him, and **try more honestly, more earnestly, more prayerfully, more habitually, even amidst all the troubles and difficulties and trivialities of each day, to cultivate that great faculty of joyful and assured hope.**

#### v.19
>and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength

Once more we are back at the old truth which we can never make too emphatic and plain, that **the one condition of the weakest among us being strong with the strength of the Lord is simple trust in Him,** verified, of course, by continuance and by effort.

**The measure of your faith is the measure of God’s power given to you.**

 The working measure of our spiritual life is our faith. In plain English, **we can have as much of God as we want. We do have as much as we want.** And if, in touch with the power that can shatter a universe, we only get a little thrill that is scarcely perceptible to ourselves, and all unnoticed by others, whose fault is that? If, coming to the fountain that laughs at drought, and can fill a universe with its waters, we scarcely bear away a straitened drop or two, that barely refreshes our parched lips, and does nothing to stimulate the growth of the plants of holiness in our gardens, whose fault is that? The practical measure of the power is for us the measure of our belief and desire. And if we only go to Him, as I pray we all may, and continue there, and ask from Him strength, according to the riches that are treasured in Jesus Christ, we shall get the old answer, ‘According to your faith be it unto you.'
