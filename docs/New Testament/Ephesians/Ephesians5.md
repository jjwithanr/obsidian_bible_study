# Ephesians 5

## Overview:



#### v.2
>and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

Christ sacrificed himself by "love," and that sacrifice was acceptable to God. So do you show love one to another. Sacrifice everything which opposes it. and it will be acceptable to God. He will approve nil which is designed to promote love, as he approved the sacrifice which was made, under the influence of love, by his Son.

#### v.3
>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.

The covetous man, according to Paul, is to be ranked with the sensual, and with idolaters Ephesians 5:5, and with those who are entirely excluded from the kingdom of God.

Who is a covetous man? A man who, in the pursuit of gold, neglects his soul, his intellect, and his heart. A man who, in this insatiable pursuit, is regardless of justice, truth, charity, faith, prayer, peace, comfort, usefulness, conscience; and who shall say that there is any vice more debasing or degrading than this?

As Christians, we are capable of sin and failure, but we should never be passive about it. When we're convicted of sin, as believers, we ought to confess it and seek to rid ourselves of it [[1John1#v 9]].  
  
The need for believers to hold each other accountable is not about being judgmental. It's a matter of the health of the entire church. Paul calls a pure church "proper among saints." Paul sought to avoid the kinds of problems experienced in Corinth (1 Corinthians 5). There, sexual immorality was tolerated in the church and caused problems for the entire congregation. **Striking a balance between fellowship and purity can be difficult, but it is necessary.**

#### v.4
>Nor should there be obscenity, **foolish talk** or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.

It means that kind of talk which is insipid, senseless, stupid, foolish; which is not suited to instruct, edify, profit - the idle "chitchat" which is so common in the world. The meaning is, that Christians should aim to have their conversation sensible, serious, sincere - remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, "that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment;" [[Matthew12#v 36]].

But levity and jesting, though often manifested by ministers and other Christians, are as inconsistent with true dignity as with the gospel. Where were they seen in the conversation of the Redeemer? Where in the writings of Paul?

They are redeemed - not to make sport; purchased with precious blood - for other purposes than to make people laugh. They are soon to be in heaven - and a man who has any impressive sense of that will habitually feel that he has much else to do than to make people laugh. The true course of life is midway between moroseness and levity; sourness and lightness; harshness and jesting. Be benevolent, kind, cheerful, bland, courteous, but serious. Be solemn, thoughtful, deeply impressed with the presence of God and with eternal things, but pleasant, affable, and benignant. Think not a smile sinful; but think not levity and jesting harmless.

It is much more appropriate to the character of Christians to come together to sing praises to God, than to sing songs; to pray than to jest; to converse of the things of redemption than to tell anecdotes, and to devote the time to a contemplation of the world to come, than to trifles and nonsense.

Lord, help me. I struggle so much with this. Have mercy on me, for I am a sinner. I have spoken many careless words.

#### v.5
>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a man is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

#### v.6-7
>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. <sup>7</sup>Therefore do not be partners with them.

#### v.10
>and find out what pleases the Lord.

But we all know, from our own happy human experience, that no motive which can be brought to bear upon men is stronger, when there are loving hearts concerned, than this simple one, **‘Do it to please me.’** And that is what Jesus Christ really says. That is no piece of mere sentiment, brethren, nor of mere pulpit rhetoric. That is the deepest thought of Christian morality, and is the distinctive peculiarity which gives the morality of the New Testament its clear supremacy over all other.

**Our miseries come from our unbridled wills**, far more than from our sensitive organisations. It is because we do not accept providences that providences hurt. It is because we do not accept the commandments that the commandments are burdensome. Those who have no will, except as it is vitalised by God’s will, have found the secret of blessedness, and have entered into rest. In the measure in which we approximate to that condition, our wills will be strengthened as well as our hearts set at ease.

#### v.11
>Have nothing to do withthe fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

By your life, your conversation, and all your influence. This is the business of Christians. Their lives should be a standing rebuke of a sinful world, and they should be ever ready to express their disapprobation of its wickedness in every form.

#### v.12
>For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.

#### v.15
>Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,

#### v.16
>making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.

#### v.18
>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead be filled with the Spirit.
