#### v.8-9
>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! <sup>9</sup>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!

#### v.10
>Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.

#### v.11-12
>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. <sup>12</sup>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.

#### v.20
>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.

#### v.23
>They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
