# Galations 1

## Overview:


#### v.4
>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

#### v.7
>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.

#### v.8-9
>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! <sup>9</sup>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!

#### v.10
>Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.

#### v.11-12
>I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. <sup>12</sup>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.

#### v.23
>They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
