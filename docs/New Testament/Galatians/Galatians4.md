# Galatians 4

## Overview:


#### v.4
>But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law,

#### v.5
>to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.

#### v.6
>Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, _“Abba_, Father.”

#### v.7
>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.

#### v.8-9
>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. <sup>9</sup>But now that you know God - or rather are known by God - how is it that you are turning back to be enslaved by them all over again?

How are you being enslaved by YouTube and media all over again?

We have already seen why the elemental spirits or principles the Galatians were in the process of turning to are "weak and miserable" (lit., "powerless and bankrupt"); they are weak because they are unable to set people free, as Christ has done by redeeming them. They are bankrupt because they have no wealth by which they can provide an inheritance.

#### v.11
>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.

What pastor has not often had such fears of his people, when he sees them turn to the weak and beggarly elements of the world, or when, after having "run well," he sees them become the slaves of fashion, or of some habit inconsistent with the simplicity of the gospel?

It can only be that they are "nearsighted and blind" and have "forgotten" that they were cleansed from old sins (se [2Pe 1:9](2Peter1#v.9)).

#### v.18
>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.
