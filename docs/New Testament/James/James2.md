# James 2

## Overview:
God does not show partiality, so neither should we. His judgement is perfect while our's is very flawed. James also proves how our faith can be flawed if it is not followed by action.

#### v.13
>because judgement without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgement!

Moffatt translates this, “The merciful life will triumph in the face of judgment.” “That is, the merciful man glorieth, as one that hath received mercy, and shall not come into condemnation; for God’s mercy rejoiceth against such a man’s sins, as against an adversary which he hath subdued and trampled on.” (Trapp)

#### v.16
>If any one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?

Pastor Ed's story of him taking two girls who lost their mother despite being a poor youth pastor with two young children.

#### v.19
>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that - and shudder.

#### v.26
>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.

Watchman Nee expands greatly on the body, soul, and spirit in *Spiritual Man*.

The man without a spirit is dead since they can't accept anything or understand anything that is spiritual - that which gives life. This nature is expounded in [1 Corinthians 2:14](1Cor2#v.14)

Believing that we can live the Christian life without the Holy Spirit dwelling inside us is just as false as claiming to have a faith that is without deeds.

#### v.23
>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," and **he was called God's friend.**

He will save you, brother, despite a thousand imperfections, but He will not call you His friend unless you are exceedingly careful to please Him in all things. Shall we draw back from the honor because of the responsibility? No, we delight in the responsibility; we thirst to be well-pleasing to God. Though our God is a consuming fire, we aspire to dwell in Him. To our new nature this fire is its element. Even now we pray that it may refine us, and consume all our dross and tin. We would gladly be baptized with the fire baptism. We wish nothing to be spared which ought to be consumed, or which can be consumed. We accept friendship with God on His own terms. I tremble while I speak. We are willing to bear anything which will make us one with God. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning; do you know what you ask when you pray to be filled with Him? I trust you will reply, “Be it what it may, I desire to feel that heavenly influence which can make me forever the friend of God.”
