# 1 Timothy 6

## Overview:
Paul returns to his correction of the false teachers' doctrines. He addreses their anthem for asceticism and clarifies that having a balance of both godliness and contenement is good since it guards the heart from the love of money. Paul sternly warns Timothy of such vices like the love of money and teaches him how to treat the wealthy in the church.


#### v.6
>But godliness *actually* is a means of great gain, when accompanied by contentment.

#### v.9
>People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.

How truly living and active the word is today!

#### v.10
>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

Paul cites here a widely used ancient proverb about loving money being the source of various evils (e.g., \*Theon, Progymnasmata 3.91-92; \*Sibylline Oracles 3.235).

#### v.11
>But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.

#### v.14
>to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

God's been showing me how emphatic Paul is on this point. There's something to this. *do more research*.

#### v.17
> Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who **richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment**.

The meaning of this seems to be, that God permits us to enjoy everything. Everything in the works of creation and redemption he has given to man for his happiness, and he should therefore trust in him. He has not merely given wealth for the comfort of people, but he has given everything, and he on whom so many and so great blessings have been bestowed for his comfort, should trust in the great Benefactor himself, and not rely merely on one of his gifts; compare notes on [1 Corinthians 3:21-23](http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm).
