# 1 Timothy 3

## Overview:
This chapter contains the qualifications for church elders and deacons. Much scrutiny involved as Paul understands the true destiny and identity of the church - to be "pillar and foundation of the truth". 


#### v.2
>Now the overseer must be above reprorach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, **able to teach**

P.D. believes that every elder should have the gift of teaching. The modern criticism he's heard from the Korean church is that today's pastors operate in the Bible's description for elders and elders for deacons.

#### v.9
>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

It means that which had been concealed, or hidden, but which was now revealed. The word “faith” here, is synonymous with “the gospel;” and the sense is, that he should hold firmly the great doctrines of the Christian religion which had been so long concealed from people, but which were now revealed. The reason is obvious. Though not a preacher, yet his influence and example would be great, and a man who held material error ought not to be in office.

#### v.15
>if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, **the pillar and foundation of the truth**.

When the Church **stands boldly out**, and **preaches the Word**, it is the pillar of the truth; when it is hidden in the Roman catacombs, and cannot proclaim the Savior’s name to the world, still there lives the truth deep in the hearts of believers, and they are then the ground of the truth.
