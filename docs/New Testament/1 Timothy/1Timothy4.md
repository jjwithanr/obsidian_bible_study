# 1 Timothy 4

## Overview:
With the context that there will be a time when some will turn away from the gospel for deceiving spirits, Paul charges Timothy to be unapologetic about his boldness in preaching the word that he might become a good minister of Christ Jesus. Despite Timothy's youth, Paul urges him to train himself to be godly and not let anyone hold him back from going all out for God with the gifts he has in him. 


#### v.1-2
>The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. <sup>2</sup>Such teachings come through hyprocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with  a **hot iron**.

The “branding iron” was especially used on livestock (but apparently at least theoretically could be used also to identify some criminals); the “searing” may thus mean that the consciences of these apostates have become the property of evil spirits.

People don't have ideas. Ideas have people...You are the tools of those ideas...It's hard to have your own ideas. You have to derive them from your own experience.

Paul prophesies a time where there is an increased spiritual, or rather anti-spiritual, tension that will stir the masses. More people will become subject to spirits and ideologies of the end times - in fact, to a point where their soul/conscience will become property of said spirits. They will be fully consumed by a spirit not of God's.

#### v.4-5
> For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, <sup>5</sup>because it is **consecreated by the word of God and prayer.

Jewish people always praised God before their meal; the normal blessing included praise for the God who “created” the fruit of the vine. Another blessing, possibly standardized in the early second century, was used after meals and included the statement **"God is good and does good."** This Jewish custom was an appropriate way to show gratitude to God for his provisions. The food was in a sense sanctified by the word of God (Gen 1:30-31) as well as by such prayer; there was thus no need to abstain from it. **Faith rather than something intrinsic to the food made the latter pure** ([Tit 1:15](Titus1.md#v.15); cf. [Mk 7:19](Mark7#v. 19); [Rom 14:14](Romans14#v.1 4)).

#### v.7
>Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.

This training was not simply for knowledge, but rather for godly living. This resembles the words of James 1:22, which commands, "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves." Learning is always meant to lead to action.

Do not occupy your time and attention with them, but rather cultivate piety, and seek to become more holy.

Do more walking than talking.

#### v.11-14
> Command and teach these things. <sup>12</sup>Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in **speech**, in **life**, in **love**, in **faith**, and in **purity**. <sup>13</sup>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scriputre, to preaching and to teaching. <sup>14</sup>*Do not neglect your gift*, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.

See more in [[preaching#Matthew Henry on 1 Timothy 4 11-16 1Timothy4 v 11-14]].

#### v.15-16
>**Be diligent** in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may **see your progress**. <sup>16</sup>Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.

It may be remarked here that no man will ever make much of himself, or accomplish much in any profession, who does not make this the rule of his life. He who has one great purpose of life to which he patiently and steadily devotes himself, and to which he makes everything else bend, will uniformly rise to high respectability, if not to eminence. He who does not do this can expect to accomplish nothing.

The fruit of a minister who has been diligent in all these matters is an apparent growing maturity in their speech, life, love, faith, and purity. Are you seeing your pastor's "progress"
