# 1 Timothy 5

## Overview:
Paul instructs Timothy on how he ought to treat the older and younger men and women in his church as a young minister. He identifies which widows are qualified to receive help from the church. Paul gives honor to the elders who do take care of these widows and diligently work for the church. Yet, he also sets standards and warnings for them.


#### v.1-2
>Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, <sup>2</sup>**older women as mothers**, and younger women as sisters, with **absolute purity**.

He knew the danger which would beset a youthful minister of the gospel when it was his duty to admonish and entreat a youthful female; he knew, too, the scandal to which he might be exposed if, in the performance of the necessary duties of his office, there should be the slightest departure from purity and propriety.

#### v.6
>But the widow who **lives for pleasure** is dead even while she lives.

See more in [James 5:5](James5#v.5). 

All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins.

There is great emphasis in this expression, and nothing could convey more forcibly the idea that true happiness is not to be found in the pleasure of sense. There is nothing in them that answers the purposes of life. They are not the objects for which life was given, and as to the great and proper designs of existence, such persons might as well be dead.
