# John 8

## Overview:


#### v.6
>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.

#### v.9
>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.

#### v.24
>I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am \[the one I claim to be\], you will indeed die in your sins."

#### v.27
>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.

#### v.29
>The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."

#### v.31
>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.

#### v.34
>Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.

Literally, this means "everyone who keeps practicing sin is a slave of sin." In other words, Jesus is now speaking of a habitual, persistent sin. Those who are free in Christ may stumble into darkness, but they do not perpetually "walk" in it (John 8:12).

Jesus' reply dealt with the spiritual aspect of freedom. Sin enslaves because every act of disobedience to God creates an atmosphere of alienation and a trend to further disobedience that inevitably makes escape impossible. An act of sin can possibly be overcome, but the attitude and habit of sin are inescapable.

#### v.44
> You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

#### v.47
>He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."

Jesus closed the argument by repeating that the Jews refused to hear him because they did not belong to God. Their bitterness toward him and their obtuseness toward his teaching contradicted their spiritual claims.

#### v.51
>I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."

A fuller statement of this principle appears in Jesus' promise to Martha ([Jn 11:25](John11#v.25)).

#### v.54
>Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
