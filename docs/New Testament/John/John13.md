# John 13

## Overview:


#### v.1
>It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.

Jesus showed the full extent of his love in washing His disciple's feet.

#### v.5
>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

#### v.10
>Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."

Those who are once-for-all washed don't need to be entirely cleansed again. That is, they have no need to be re-saved. Rather, they need to have the incidental "dirt" of their daily walk washed. Our fellowship with Christ is impacted by unconfessed sin. Those who are "clean" are those who've experienced spiritual cleansing. For such people, only the minor foot-washing is needed. But those who've never been "bathed" entirely are the unsavedâ€”like Judas, who is "unclean."
