# John 5

## Overview:
A surprisingly great chapter to prove the doctrine of the Trinity.

#### v.2
>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.

Aramaic pops up more often than I thought in the Bible. Peter's name Cephas was Aramaic and this location we cite from the Bible is Aramaic.

#### v.11
>But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"

Jesus is Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End. He is Faithful and True. He is the Son of God. But let me never forget this: he is the man who made me well.

#### v.14
>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."

At another healing, Jesus will make the point that not all suffering is the result of a person's own sin (John 9:3). Here, however, Jesus' words seem to connect the man's prior condition to sin. It may have been that the man's disability was the result of personal choices. At the same time, Jesus may simply be reminding the man that there are worse things than being crippled, including the eternal penalties of sin ([Luke 12:4–5](Luke12#v.4-5)).

#### v.17
>Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."

#### v.18
>For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

Wya JWs, Mormons, and Unitarians?

#### v.21
>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.

#### v.22-23
>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <sup>23</sup>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.

#### v.24
>"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.

#### v.28-29
>"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice <sup>29</sup>and come out—those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.

Resurrection of the both the righteous and the wicked. Similar to [[Revelation20]].

#### v.30
>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.

#### v.38
>nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.

#### v.39-40
>You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, <sup>40</sup>yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

#### v.41
>"I do not accept praise from men,

#### v.42
>but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.

#### v.44
>How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God?

#### v.45
>"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.

#### v.46
>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.

#### v.47
>But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"

Similar to [[Luke16#v.31]].
