# John 9

## Overview:


#### v.3
>"Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.

#### v.4
>As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.

#### v.31
>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.

Since, according to the assumption of the Jews, "God does not listen to sinners," (cf. [Ps 66:18](Psalm66#v.18); [Pr 28:9](Proverbs28#v.9); [Isa 1:15](Isaiah1#v.15)), how could Jesus have performed this miracle if he were under divine condemnation?

#### v.39
>Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."

#### v.41
>Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.

Jesus' reply indicated that if they had acknowledged blindness, they could be freed from sin; but since they were asserting that they could see when they were really blind, there was no remedy for them. Deliberate rejection of light means that "the light within... is darkness" ([Mt 6:23](Matthew6#v.22-23)).
