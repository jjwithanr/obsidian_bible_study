# John 4

## Overview:


#### v.2
>although in fact it was Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.

#### v.14
>but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.

#### v.22
>You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.

Probably he was alluding to the error of the woman's ancestor's, who had accepted a syncretism of foreign deities with the ancestral God of the Jewish faith.

**Jesus is not neutral; he accepts the correctness of the Jewish position**, although he does not allow that to remain as an ultimate barrier to ethnic reconciliation (4:23). In a Gospel probably at least partly addressing Jewish Christians rejected by their synagogues (see the introduction), this point is significant.

#### v.23
>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

#### v.24
>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."

#### v.29
>"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?"

#### v.34
>"My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.

He tried to tell them that the satisfaction of completing the work the Father had entrusted to him was greater tahn any food he might have been given (cf. [Dt 8:3](Deut8#v.3); [Mt 4:4](Matthew4#v.4)).

#### v.38
>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."

The reaping of people for the granary of God is not the task of any one group, nor is it confined to one era. Each reaps the benefit of its forerunners, and succeeding generations in turn gain from the accomplishments of their predecessors (see [1Co 3:6](1Cor3#v.6-7)). Perhaps v.38 is an allusion to the preaching of John the Baptist, whose message of repentance had prepared the way for the disciple's preaching about Jesus.

#### v.39
>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."

#### v.40
>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.

Just like the road to Emmaus.

#### v.42
>They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."

The second stage was hearing for themselves... They had progressed from a faith built on the witness of another to a faith built on their own experience.

#### v.53
>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." **So he and all his household believed.**
