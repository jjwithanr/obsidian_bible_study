# John 6

## Overview:



#### v.6
>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.

#### v.27
>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."

Hearing one teaching from one preacher can get us hooked in repeatedly consuming his messages. Those messages and the preacher himself have an end. Yet, Jesus promises that His food is eternal.

#### v.29
>Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."

#### v.56
>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.

Eating is the taking into yourself of something which exists externally, which you receive into yourself, and which becomes a part of yourself and helps to build you up, and sustain you. That something supplies a great need of your nature, and when you receive it, it nourishes your life. That is the essence of the metaphor, and it well describes the act and the result of faith.
