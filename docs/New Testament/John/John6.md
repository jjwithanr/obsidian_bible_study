# John 6

## Overview:



#### v.6
>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.

#### v.27
>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."

Hearing one teaching from one preacher can get us hooked in repeatedly consuming his messages. Those messages and the preacher himself have an end. Yet, Jesus promises that His food is eternal.
