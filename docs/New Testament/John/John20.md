# John 20

## Overview:


#### v.17
>Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, `I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"

#### v.21
>Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."

Jesus is our greatest example of a Sender.

#### v.23
>If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."

The commission to forgive sins is phrased in an unusual construction. Literally it is: "Those whose sins you forgave have already been forgiven; those whose sins you do not forgive have not been forgiven" (similarly also Mt 16:19; see comments). God does not forgive people's sins because we decide to do so, nor does he withold forgiveness because we will not grant it. We announce it; we do not create it. This is the essence of salvation. And all who proclaim the Gospel are in efect forgiving or not forgiving sins, depending whether the hearer accepts or rejects the Lord Jesus as the Sin-Bearer.
