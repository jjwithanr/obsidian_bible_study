# John 14

## Overview:


#### v.1
>"Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.

#### v.3
>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.

*With every breath I long to follow Jesus  
For He has said that He will bring me home  
And day by day I know He will renew me  
Until I stand with joy before the throne

To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus  
All the glory evermore to Him  
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat  
Yet not I, but through Christ in me*

- Yet Not I but Through Christ in Me

#### v.6
>Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

#### v.21
>Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him."

The knowledge of God is not an intellectual exercise. It is the reward of obedience.
