# John 10

## Overview:

#### v.1
>"I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. 

#### v.4
>When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.

#### v.5
>But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice."

#### v.10
>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

#### v.11
>"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

In claiming to be the good shepherd, there is little question as to what Jesus is referring. This claim of Jesus is why the crowd was so divided—could He really be the one Ezekiel 34 talked about?

Although it is true that being a shepherd would communicate ideas of love and leadership, the main reason John includes this passage is to show us that Jesus was claiming to be the Messianic Son of God. Jesus was the one whom God had appointed as the leader and shepherd of Israel in [Ezekiel 34](Ezekiel34). He was the descendant of David, the shepherd for all of Israel—a divine figure.

#### v.13
>The man runs away because he is a hired man and cares nothing for the sheep.

The good shepherd uses himself as protection against evil; the hired hand uses the sheep as protection against evil. Pastors do not duck behind their congregation when troubles come. They lay their lives down for them.

#### v.17
>The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again.

#### v.20
>Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?

#### v.34-36
>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? <sup>35</sup>If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—<sup>36</sup>what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?
