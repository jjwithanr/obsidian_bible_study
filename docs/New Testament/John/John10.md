# John 10

## Overview:

#### v.1
>"I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. 

#### v.4
>When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.

#### v.5
>But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice."

#### v.10
>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

#### v.11
>"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

#### v.13
>The man runs away because he is a hired man and cares nothing for the sheep.

The good shepherd uses himself as protection against evil; the hired hand uses the sheep as protection against evil. Pastors do not duck behind their congregation when troubles come. They lay their lives down for them.

#### v.17
>The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again.

#### v.20
>Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?

#### v.34-36
>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? <sup>35</sup>If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—<sup>36</sup>what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?
