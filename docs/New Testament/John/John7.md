# John 7

## Overview:


#### v.5
>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.

#### v.6
>Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.

#### v.7
>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.

#### v.10
>However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.

#### v.17
>If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.

"If any one chooses to do God's will" means there must be a definite act of the human will in order to do God's will—a settled, determined purpose to fulfill it. Spiritual understanding is not produced solely by learning facts or procedures; rather, it depends on obedience to known truth. Obedience to God's known will develops discernment between falsehood and truth.

#### v.18
>He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.

#### v.19
>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"

#### v.23
>Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?

#### v.24
>Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."

#### v.37
>On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.

#### v.38
>Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."

#### v.39
>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.

#### v.43
>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.

#### v.46
>"No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.

#### v.47-48
>"You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted. <sup>48</sup>"Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?

And their other statements reveal their religious snobbishness. They assumed that nobody could be right except themselves. If they did not believe in Jesus, he must be unreliable and his claims must be fraudulent.

#### v.49
>No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them."

Connection to verse 19 and what Paul says in [Galatians 3:10](Galatians3#v.10).

#### v.50-51
>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, <sup>51</sup>"Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?"

#### v.52
>They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."

The statement "a prophet does not come out of Galilee" seems inconsistent with the fact that some of the OT prophets, like Jonah, did originate from northern Israel.
