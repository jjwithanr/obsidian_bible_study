# John 15

## Overview:


#### v.4
>Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit from itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither _can_ you unless you abide in Me.

A Christian magazine that featured Hudson Taylor in one of its issues referred to how Taylor struggled for a closer walk with God. Although he is considered one of the greatest missionary champions of church history, he longed for a more intimate re- lationship with Christ. "I prayed, agonized, fasted, strove, made resolutions, read the word more diligently, sought more time for retirement and meditationâ€”but all was without effect," he pined. "I knew that if I would abide in Christ all would be well, but I could not." Taylor reached a turning point in his life when he received a letter from a colleague. This simple message unlocked the door: ==="Friendship with God comes not from striving after faith but from resting in the faithful one." ===Those simple words were somehow precisely what Hudson Taylor needed to help him cross a threshold in his relationship with Christ. He was able to cease striving and to embrace Christ's nearness and power and life. I refer to Taylor's experience, not as though it's a formula for learning to abide in Christ, but rather to show that the most eminent of saints have wrestled with this very issue.
