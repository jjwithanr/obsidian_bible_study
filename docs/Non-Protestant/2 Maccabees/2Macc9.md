# 2 Maccabees 9

## Overview:


#### v.1
>About that time, as it happened, Antiochus had retreated in disorder from the region of Persia.

#### v.2
>He had entered the city called Persepolis and attempted to rob the temples and control the city. Therefore the people rushed to the rescue with arms, and Antiochus and his army were defeated, with the result that Antiochus was put to flight by the inhabitants and beat a shameful retreat.

#### v.3
>While he was in Ecbatana, news came to him of what had happened to Nicanor and the forces of Timothy.

#### v.4
>Transported with rage, he conceived the idea of turning upon the Jews the injury done by those who had put him to flight, so he ordered his charioteer to drive without stopping until he completed the journey. But the judgment of heaven rode with him! For in his arrogance he said, “When I get there I will make Jerusalem a cemetery of Jews.”

#### v.5
>But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with an incurable and invisible blow. As soon as he stopped speaking, he was seized with a pain in his bowels for which there was no relief and with sharp internal tortures—

#### v.6
>and that very justly, for he had tortured the bowels of others with many and strange inflictions.

#### v.7
>Yet he did not in any way stop his insolence but was even more filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his rage against the Jews and giving orders to drive even faster. And so it came about that he fell out of his chariot as it was rushing along, and the fall was so hard as to torture every limb of his body.

#### v.8
>Thus he, who only a little while before had thought in his superhuman arrogance that he could command the waves of the sea and had imagined that he could weigh the high mountains in a balance, was brought down to earth and carried in a litter, making the power of God manifest to all.

#### v.9
>And so the ungodly man’s body swarmed with worms, and while he was still living in anguish and pain, his flesh rotted away, and because of the stench the whole army felt revulsion at his decay.

#### v.10
>Because of his intolerable stench no one was able to carry the man who a little while before had thought that he could touch the stars of heaven.

#### v.11
>Then it was that, broken in spirit, he began to lose much of his arrogance and to come to his senses under the scourge of God, for he was tortured with pain every moment.

#### v.12
>And when he could not endure his own stench, he uttered these words, “It is right to be subject to God; mortals should not think that they are equal to God.”

#### v.13
>Then the abominable fellow made a vow to the Lord, who would no longer have mercy on him, stating

#### v.14
>that the holy city, which he was hurrying to level to the ground and to make a cemetery, he was now declaring to be free,

#### v.15
>and the Jews, whom he had not considered worth burying but had planned to throw out with their children for the wild animals and for the birds to eat, he would make, all of them, equal to citizens of Athens,

#### v.16
>and the holy sanctuary, which he had formerly plundered, he would adorn with the finest offerings, and all the holy vessels he would give back many times over, and the expenses incurred for the sacrifices he would provide from his own revenues,

#### v.17
>and in addition to all this he also would become a Jew and would visit every inhabited place to proclaim the power of God.

#### v.18
>But when his sufferings did not in any way abate, for the judgment of God had justly come upon him, he gave up all hope for himself and wrote to the Jews the following letter, in the form of a supplication. This was its content:

#### v.19
>“To his worthy Jewish citizens, Antiochus their king and general sends hearty greetings and good wishes for their health and prosperity.

#### v.20
>If you and your children are well and your affairs are as you wish, I am glad as my hope is in heaven.

#### v.21
>Now I was feeling weak, and so I was remembering with affection your esteem and goodwill. On my way back from the region of Persia I suffered an annoying illness, and I have deemed it necessary to take thought for the general security of all.

#### v.22
>I do not despair of my condition, for I have good hope of recovering from my illness,

#### v.23
>but I observed that my father, on the occasions when he made expeditions into the upper country, appointed his successor,

#### v.24
>so that, if anything unexpected happened or any unwelcome news came, the people throughout the realm would not be troubled, for they would know to whom the government was left.

#### v.25
>Moreover, I understand how the princes along the borders and the neighbors of my kingdom keep watching for opportunities and waiting to see what will happen. So I have appointed my son Antiochus to be king, whom I have often entrusted and commended to most of you when I hurried off to the upper provinces, and I have written to him the appended letter.

#### v.26
>I therefore urge and beg you to remember the public and private services rendered to you and to maintain your present goodwill, each of you, toward me and my son.

#### v.27
>For I am sure that he will follow my policy and will treat you with moderation and kindness.”

#### v.28
>So the murderer and blasphemer, having endured the more intense suffering such as he had inflicted on others, came to the end of his life by a most pitiable fate, among the mountains in a strange land.

#### v.29
>And Philip, one of his courtiers, took his body home; then, fearing the son of Antiochus, he withdrew to Ptolemy Philometor in Egypt.
