##### What I learned:
1. *There is nothing archaic, solemn or mystical about the kind of language used by the inspired authors of the New Testament. It is the Greek of the street. This says a great deal about the nature of God's revelation. Just as God took on the form of common humanity when he revealed himself as the living Word, so his written Word was revealed in language that the person on the street could understand.  - Mark Strauss, Distorting Scripture?* (166) 
1. The New Testament was penned in _Koine_, a simplified version of classical Greek that had gained widespread usage in the East thanks to Alexander the Great's conquests.
1. Some elevate language above God since some claim language is how we live and move and have our being.
	1. An easy rebuttal is the claim that infants are relational even prior to language.
2. *Understanding language as created and so secondary has a number of implications. First, that God has created language implies that language is adequate for the task of communication and theology.* (170)
