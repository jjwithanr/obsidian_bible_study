##### What I learned:
1. Brown's students read Genesis and were put off by reading about Lot's incest. We may have been trained to emulate what we read in narrative, but that's why understanding genre is important for the interpretive process.
2. *Most of us have been trained to think that whatever unit of Scripture we select to study must have at least one point of application.* (245)
3. Two questions for contextualization: coherence and purpose.
