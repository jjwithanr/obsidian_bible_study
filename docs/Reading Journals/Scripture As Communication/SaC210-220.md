##### What I learned:
1. Reading 1 Corinthians 13 in context of chapters 11-14 reveals Paul's assessment that they are using spiritual gifts without love.
1. Picking out parts of Scripture for our reading is like taking a friend's letter and reading the middle paragraph today and the introductory section two months later.
1. Proof-texting is taking a Bible verse out of its literary context to fit into a framework of interpretation: "the smallest atoms of the text are torn away from their textual... contexts and reassembled within some other framework of interpretation, often in order to demonstrate a point that is anything but natural to them." (214)
2. *While [Philippians 4:13](Philippians4#v.13) probably has been used to claim strength for any number of endeavors, in the immediate context Paul is interested in one particular Christian attitudeâ€”contentment (4:10-19).* (215)
3. A common usage of proof-texting are in Bible studies where a conclusion of a certain topic is stated preceding surveying particular verses that prove the point. There is a tendency to assume a certain way of reading the text rather interpreting them in their literary contexts.
