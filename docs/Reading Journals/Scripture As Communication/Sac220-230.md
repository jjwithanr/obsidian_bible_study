##### What I learned:
1. Themes that appear as "bookends" are inclusios.
1. *In John's Gospel, themes are combined with particular Jewish festival settings to emphasize some aspects of Jesus' identity in relation to his followers. For instance, the setting of John 6 is the Jewish Passover, in which unleavened bread plays an important role (see Exod. 12:1-20). The Passover becomes the setting for Jesus' feeding of the five thousand (John 6:1-15), his claim to be the bread of life (6:35; see 6:32-33), and the dialogue that surrounds this claim (6:25-59). Thus, the motif of bread, the Passover setting, and the controversy around Jesus' claim to be the bread of life all work together to highlight Jesus' identity and role as the sustenance of his people (see John 6:53-58).* (220)
1. *The choice of genre is fundamental to the fulfillment of these authorial purposes.* (221)
2. Exegetical skills for studying literary context:
	1. Outlining a book
	2. Summarizing
	3. Identifying themes
	4. Identifying the function of a particular text in relation to its literary context
3. Intertextuality
	1. The verb "remember" in [1 Samuel 1:19](1Samuel1#v.19) is also used in Genesis and Exodus for activities tied to God's covenant. The reader, knowing this, would hear covenantal overtones in the birth story of Samuel.
4. *All of Scripture together points to a coherent picture of God's redemptive work in creation and humanity.* (229)
