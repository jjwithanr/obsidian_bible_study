##### What I learned:
1. The author's choice of genre is a primary part of the communicative choices.
1. *While in an epistle an author seeks to persuade through a course of reasoning that is fairly explicit and often linear, narrative authors do their "persuading" most often implicitly, through story and point of view.* (140)
1. Hebrew poetry does not share characteristics like rhyme and meter with English poetry, but it does also utilize alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia, and wordplay.
2. *As A. Berkeley Mickelson has warned, "The very essence of poetry is destroyed if we are absorbed in the mechanics of it."* (148)
3. In poetry, authors select words for their sound, form, and metaphorical qualities which contribute to poetry's compactness compared to prose. David in Psalm 51 uses a dozen occurrences of five different words to describe sin. It would be a misreading to look too deeply into these five instances and emphasize its nuances.
