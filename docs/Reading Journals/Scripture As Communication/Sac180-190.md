##### What I learned:
1. NT authors may use the same term with different senses: James uses pistis as affirmation of Christian truth (which demons exhibit) and Paul uses it as trust.
1. *The less familiar we are with a language, the more likely we are to treat it artificially.* (182)
1. Linguistic Pitfalls to Avoid
	1. Don't infer the meaning of a word from its etymology.
	2. Don't infer the meaning of a word from its later usage.
		1. An example is how we define the term martyr.
	3. Don't read all possible meanings of a word into a specific usage.
		1. *It essentially collapses the norms of language (all possible meanings of a word) into the norms of utterance (the specific meaning intended in an utterance).* (186)
	4. Don't overemphasize fine points of grammar.
2. God created language as good but sin has tainted our ability to fully understand it and avoid misunderstandings. Yet, God uses human language as a vehicle of his perfect truth.
