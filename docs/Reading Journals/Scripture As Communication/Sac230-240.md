##### What I learned:
1. We often move intuitively between exegesis and contextualization.
2. Figure on page 236
3. *We...read the text, examining it in all its historical otherness to ourselves as well as all its transtemporal relatedness to ourselves, and being aware of the complex relation that exists between those two things.* Wright (236) 
4. Contextualization can be understood as movement between the text and the reader.
5. *Our natural tendency to domesticate the text—to make it say what we would like it to say—is minimized when we take seriously the distance between our settings and the biblical world.* (240)
6. Contextualization can also be understood as participation where we observe the resonances between the two worlds of the author and reader. We can engage the text assuming some continuity.
