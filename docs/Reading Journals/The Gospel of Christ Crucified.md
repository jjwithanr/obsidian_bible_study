##### What I learned:
1. Heavens are described as plural, physical, and continous in Scripture. There are multiple heavens.
1. Biblical theology is best summarized as *cruciform apocalypticism*.
1. Platonism, realized eschatology, and evolutionism are the source of most historical corruptions of the apostolic witness.

##### Interesting:
1. The day of the Lord is the predominant theme of the Scriptures. (pg.3)

##### What I learned:
1. Proof that the Bible is divinely inspired is the overcoming of death itself. Acts 17:24-31
1. Martin Luther identified the "evangelical church" as those who believed in *sola sciptura* compared to the Roman Catholic Church who believed in traditions.
1. Worldview can be defined as "an interpretive framework through which or by which one makes sense out of the data of life and the world."

##### Interesting:
1. As we consider the importance of hermeneutics and worldview, it begs the question: what is God's worldview?
