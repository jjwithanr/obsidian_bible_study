#### 2022-07-05 22:03 Pages xi-8
##### What I learned:
1. Heavens are described as plural, physical, and continous in Scripture. There are multiple heavens.
2. Biblical theology is best summarized as *cruciform apocalypticism*.
3. Platonism, realized eschatology, and evolutionism are the source of most historical corruptions of the apostolic witness.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The day of the Lord is the predominant theme of the Scriptures.* (pg.3)

##### What I learned:
1. Proof that the Bible is divinely inspired is the overcoming of death itself. Acts 17:24-31
2. Martin Luther identified the "evangelical church" as those who believed in *sola sciptura* compared to the Roman Catholic Church who believed in traditions.
3. Worldview can be defined as "an interpretive framework through which or by which one makes sense out of the data of life and the world."

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In addition, we must ask the gerater question: What is the worldview of the Holy Spirit? Since God is a person, how does he view life? What intuitively seems true to him? What are his assumptions? How does he interpret existence?* (13)

##### What I learned:
1. Worldview components:
	1. Metaphysics (structure of existence)
	2. Protology (study of origins)
	3. Eschatology (study of final things)
	4. Soteriology (study of salvation)
2. Ancient Hellenism viewed reality dualistically: material versus immaterial (natural and supernatural). This is similar to Plato's fundamental view of the universe which slowly became the playing field upon which Judeo-Christianity was played.
3. Jews didn't have a Christoplatonic view of the afterlife; rather, they sought new bodies post-death for them to live in a new heavena and a new earth.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Instead of a story line that ended in the restoration of all things and the resurrection of the body, the church began to look forward to the eternal existence of the soul in an immaterial heaven.* (20)

##### What I learned:
1. The Bible always refers to the heavens as plural.
2. The heavens are continuous where there are no clear lines of distinction between them but there are delineations between parts as Paul describes the "third heaven." This concept also allows for ease of movement between the heavens and the earth.
3. It is a Neoplatonic concept that there is a singular, ethereal heaven. Scripture describe the heavens as tangible, substantial, and concrete. It is physical.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The delineation of the heavens and the earth, however, does not imply a metaphysical split between the two, but rather a functional and governmental categorization.* (24)
- *God dwells within creation as a human being dwells within a tent. But why does this matter? Proximity evokes pathos.* (27)

##### What I learned:
1.  The common ancient person believed deities resided in literal and real garden-temples. Humans were created in the image of God to rule over the whole earth—starting with Eden as prototypical garden-temple. 
2. The Garden of Eden share similarities with the eschatological temlple Jerusalem:
	1. God walked in both
	2. Humans are commanded to serve/work and keep/guard in both
	3. Both structures are threefold and face the east
	4. Both are situated on a mountain
	5. Rivers flow out of both
	6. Precious metals and stones are used in and adorn both
	7. Trees filled the garden and arboreal decorations adorned the temple
3. The Bible uses "equivocal language" concerning the nature of the cosmos so that it would be equally open to interpretation throughout time and across cultures.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Thus the protological reality of humanity's kingly priesthood before God is deduced from the eschatological reality.* (page 31)
- *The heavens and the earth were created to enhance the glory of God as reflected in the creation of mankind, and consequently the two realities organically correspond to one another.* (33)

##### What I learned:
1. Not all Near Eastern peoples saw the world as (1) the heavens, (2) the earth, and (3) the underworld. 
1. Socrates -> Plato -> The Academy -> Aristotle -> Ptolemy, Cassander, Alexander the Great
1. Hellenism (Hellenstic AGe was from 323 B.C. to 30 B.C.) layed the historical foundation for the development of Western society.
2. Many view Greek philosophical thought as harmless or even beneficial to the Christian faith, but its liking of humanism proves implicictly deceptive of the true apostolic witness.
3. The divergence in a Greek and Hebrew view of the universe led to an undermining of the reality of heaven and the literal return Jesus to a new creation.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Those who seek reality in materiality by their senses are thus "barbarians" who live without divine inspiration. Hence, those who seek to see with their eyes are actually blind.* (page 39) 
- *Thus, anthropocentrism, or "human-centeredness," is the defining characteristic of the entire system of thought. The starting point of Hellenistic philosophy and all subsequent Wester tradition is this: The parameters of reality are defined by human perception.* (39)
- *I believe that it can be confidently asserted that the dominant source of heresy in the early church was Hellenistic philosophy and mythology, which were diametrically opposed to the faith and tradition of Judaism in the second-temple period.* (41)

##### What I learned:
1. The Scriptures are increasingly apocalyptic—meaning God is progressively revealing himself in relation to the ultimate end of history.
2. History is moving unilaterally toward the climactic and cataclysmic day of the Lord.
3. Jesus' return is the anchor of New Testament hope.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *I believe we must appraoch \[the Scriptures\] as a progressive revelation from God conerning his relations with humanity.* (46)
- *Hence, I believe Ernst Kasemann was quite right when he famously stated, "Apocalyptic was the mother of all Christian theology."* (48)
