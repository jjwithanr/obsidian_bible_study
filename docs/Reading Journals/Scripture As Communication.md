# Scripture As Communication
## Jeannine K. Brown



#### Pages 70-80
##### What I learned:
1. *Repeated interaction with a text—particularly with the awareness of one's own presuppositions, the otherness of the text, and the storied nature of the whole—can move one productively toward textual understanding.* (74)
1. 🔥*At its heart, the hermeneutical process is open-ended, never fully completed. Maybe this should not surprise us, since an interpersonal view of hermeneutics invites the analogy of relationship or friendship, whose goal is not completion for its own sake but continual longing to know and be known.* (74)

##### What I learned:
1. The basis of the Great Commission is rooted in the authority of Jesus through his presence with his followers, a major stress in Matthew since it begins and ends with this theme ([1:23](Matthew1#v.23); [28:20](Matthew28#v.18-20)). (86)
1. Where the author places certain verses affects its meaning. The culmination of Matthew is 28:17-20 where the readers hear how the now eleven disciples still struggled to trust Jesus and grasp who he truly is. Matthew describes the disciples with "little faith" five times.  (86)
1. *Determinacy means that interpretations can be weighed on the basis of their alignment and coherence with an author's communicative intention. It means that, in interpretative theory, we can describe and explore the limits of meaning (we can affirm its bounded nature).* (87)
2. *Each time we return to the text we are different: we ask different questions, we bring different issues, we arrive at different insights. Our contextualizing of the text occurs between the textual world and our world, and this interaction helps to explain our experience of flux in relation to meaning.* (88)
3. Although we cannot access meaning perfectly, we should still try to reach for it. Some may argue that truth is relative since no human can know truth in any objective fashion. Others who claim the existence of objective truth also posit the existence of objective knowledge—meaning we can view truth from an objective vantage point. To avoid extremes, we *clearly distinguish between objective truth or reality and the always-subjective human appropriation of truth* (89).

##### What I learned:
1.  John may be using ambiguous wordplay in [John 1:5](John1#v.5) when he says the darkness has not **katalambanó** it. It can be translated as either "understood" or "overcome." In 12:35, darkness overcomes the light but misunderstanding is a  Johannine motif (8:27). (92)
2. In John 3, he plays on the word **anóthen** which can mean either "from above" or "again." Jesus says a person must be born from above (3:3; confirmed at 3:12-13), while Nicodemus misunderstands and gets preoccupied by the literal notion of being born again (3:4). (93)
3. There is a probably wordplay on **zōn** when Jesus offers "living water" but the Samaritan woman may have misheard as "running water." (93)
4. We need to be aware of our cultural gaps from the Bible when we approach the text. Most ascribe Jonah's running away from God's call to cowardice. However this does not come from the text—only the fear of God is mentioned in [1:9](Jonah1#v.9). His real reason is made apparent when understanding the social world of his day. Jonah, an Israelite, flees God's command to preach at the capital city of Israel's archenemy out of hatred of his enemies as well as knowing God would show mercy if they repented. (93-94)
5. Most of us in the West tend to individualistically read [1 Corinthians 3:16](1Cor3#v.16) hearing the singular "you" when Paul says "Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (NASB). What's surprising is that Paul is referring to the corporate church as God's temple and dwelling place for God's Spirit—clearly indicated from his usage of the second-person plural form ("you") in the Greek. (94)
6. *In my reading, Paul's central concern in 1 Corinthians 8 is the Corinthian's participation in idolatry as they join in temple feasts. 🔥The root problem is idolatry, specifically, attempting to affirm one's allegiance to the one true God, while playing at the edges of idolatrous practice, when the call of God is to exclusive allegiance🔥. This normative stance seems quite transferable to my cultural context, since today's contemporary church struggles with compromised allegiance, as did the Corinthian church, although not in relation to temple feasts. For instance, the siren song of materialism woos us from wholehearted allegiance to God toward placing possessions, money, and comfort at the center of our existence. The normative song of resistance to idolatrous temptations resonates well in this different key.* (96)

##### What I learned:
1. *Particularly helpful is the observation that, by citing a brief part of another text or even alluding to it, an author may be evoking the entire context, message, or story of that other text. One example is the recognition that an important way the Gospel writers communicate the fulfillment of Israel's promised restoration in Jesus is by evoking Isaiah's "new exodus" motif (e.g. Matt. 1-2; Mark 1:1-3)… this way of evoking whole stories and ideas by means of allusion makes much sense of how we understand New Testament writers using Old Testament texts.* (110)
1. Terms
	1. Locution - a saying/utterance
	2. Illocution  - what the saying does
	3. Perlocution - response of a hearer
2. EXAMPLE:
	1. I call out to Libby, "Watch out for the geese!" (locution)
	2. The illocutionary act is an act of warning and want to elicit a certain response from Libby (perlocution).
	3. If Libby **understands** my warning, my illocution is successful.
	4. If Libby move away from the geese, my perlocutionary intention will have been successful.
3. *In the end, how are these distinctions important for interpreting the Bible? They are important because, as is so often the case, the writers of Scripture have perlocutionary intentions for their audience beyond understanding what is communicated. Biblical authors certainly want to be understood when they warn and exhort and plead and praise. Yet they also have intentions for their audience that go beyond simply understanding what they are saying and doing with their words. The authors have as extensions of their communicative intentions the shaping of their audience to respond in certain ways. They warn so that their audience will be deterred from harm; they exhort so that their audience will follow the paths they set forth; they praise God—and implicitly invite their audience into of God with them.* (114)
4. sensus plenior - the "fuller sense" of the text in later contexts.
5. "applicational elephants... from interpretive threads."
