### A Church In Every People
**Donald McGavran**
- The conglomerate church approach is slow to multiply in an organic indigenous way and tends to uneccesarily ostracize new converts from their kinsmen.
>Encourage converts to remain thoroughly with their peole in most matters. Please note that word "most." They cannot remain one with their people in idolatry or drunkenness or obvious sin. (630)

- Encourage group decisions for Christ so new converts are not ostracised.
>If only one person decides to follow Jesus, do not baptize him immediately. Say to him, "You and I will work together to lead another five, or ten, or God willing, 50 of your people to accept Jesus Christ as Saviour so that when you are baptized, you will be baptized with them." Ostracism is very effective against one lone person. But ostracism is weak indeed when exercised against a group of a dozen. And when exercised against 200 it has practically no force at all. (630)

>Between the two evils of giving them too little Christian teaching or allowing them to become a sealed-off community that cannot reach its own people, the latter is much the greater danger. *We must not allow new converts to become sealed off.* We must continue to make sure that a constant stream of new converts comes into the evergrowing cluster of congregations. (631)
