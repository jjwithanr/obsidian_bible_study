### The Spontaneous Multiplication of Churches
**George Patterson**
>A weak pastor dominates his congregation. He tries to do everything or delegates it in a demanding way. He herds rather than leads (both Jesus and Peter prohibit herding in a demanding way: Matt 20:25-28; 1 Pet 5:1-4)... A strong missionary, like a strong pastor, does not fear to give authority and responsibility to others. He does not force gifted, willing workers into existing slots in his organization, but rather builds ministries around them. (638)
- ABC's of discipling and church planting:
	1. Repent and believe (Mark 1:15)
	2. Be baptized and continue in new life (Matt 28:18-20; Acts 2:38; Rom 6:1-11)
	3. Love God and neighbor in a practical way (Matt 22:37-40)
	4. Celebrate the Lord's Supper (Luke 22:17-20)
	5. Pray (Matt 6:5-15)
	6. Give (Matt 6:19-21; Luke 6:38)
	7. Disciple others (Matt 28:18-20)

>Teaching heavy theology *before* one learns loving, childlike obedience is dangerous. It leaves a person assuming that Christianity is having scripturally correct doctrine and he leaves it at that. He beomes a passive learner of the Word rather than an active disciple. (639)

- Don't forcefullly drag new converts away from their family members and close friends. The Holy Spirit flows through existing bonds like through Cornelius in Acts 10:24,44.
