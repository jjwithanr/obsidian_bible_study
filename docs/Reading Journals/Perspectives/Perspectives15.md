## Week 15 - World Christian Discipleship
2022-12-10

### Beyond Loving the World
**David Bryant**
- God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. → God loves His Son and has a wonderful plan for Him, to bring all the nations to His feet as Lord of all, and He loves you and me enough to give us a place in it.
- Like the four characters in Narnia, when we have been delivered from the dominion of darkness into the kingdom of the Son, we enter an ongoing story and war rooted in ancient history. 
- Purpose-drive life → Person-driven life
- Sometimes we treat Jesus as a mascot. Once a week, He rebuilds our confidence and cheers us up. Then we do the rest of the week with little reliance on Him.
- Psalm 110 illustrates His increasing kingdom in the day of His wrath while we remain in the day of battle.

### Life on Purpose
**Claude Hickman, Steven C. Hawthorne, Todd Ahrend**
- Better to think of the Bible as a compassion that gives us direction rather than a map that gives us directions. Maps will change from season to season, the compass is the same for all of God's people.
