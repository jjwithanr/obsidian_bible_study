##### What I learned:
1. John 2:19 indicates Jesus himself was active in his resurrection in addition to God the Father.
1. To avoid kenosis theology, it is important to interpret "Christ emptying himself" as a change of role or status, not essential attributes or nature.
1. Jesus had two distinct wills (human will and divine will) that belonged to His two distinct natures. It is important to understand this knowing that whatever Christ did, the person of Christ did as a whole being.
2. Luke 24:25-26 supports the necessity for Christ to suffer and die to atone for all our sins.
3. Grudem dissects the Greek to show that Jesus was continually being tempted throughout his forty day fast in the wilderness.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *If Jesus is not fully God, we have no salvation and ultimately no Christianity.* (690)

##### What I learned:
1. The "descended into hell" phrase at the end of the Apostle's Creed has caused a lot misunderstanding in whether Jesus went to hell after he was crucified. Grudem supports removing it from the Apostle's Creed.
1. We can interpret 1 Peter 3:19-20 the way Augustine proposed: *When Noah was building the ark, Christ "in spirit" was preaching through Noah to the hostile unbelievers around him.*
1. Particular redemption seeks to avoid the doctrinal error that everyone is saved if "Christ died for the world." Grudem admits unbelievers generally avoid such error when hearing that statement however.
2. 1 Cor 15:20-23 shows that we will also have raised bodies like Christ since "He is the firstfruit" of future resurrection of the saints.
3. Jesus' post-resurrection body was unique in that his bodily scars were retained to serve as an eternal reminder of his work on the cross. For us, we will be made whole and fully healed.
4. Heaven exists as a place in the space-time universe, in contrary to what Gargarin said as the first astronaut in space.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Paul knew that even in this life the resurrection of Christ gave new power for Christian ministry and obedience to God.* (755) on [[Philippians3#v 10]]

##### What I learned:
1. Christ's session refers to the fact that he sat down at the right hand of God. Session is no longer used this way in English.
1. Christ's ascension means we are able to share now in Christ's authority over the universe and will later share in it more fully.
1. Jesus is truly and fully a prophet but NT avoids calling him that because Jesus himself is the subject of all the OT prophecies and is himself the source of revelation from God.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Of course, since he is fully God, the being of the Holy Spirit is always present everywhere (he is omnipresent), but he does not always show his presence in activities that bring blessing* (779)

##### What I learned:
1. The Holy Spirit has some restraining influence on unbelievers since he convicts the world of sin (John 16:8-11).
1. 2 Corinthians 13:14 shows that Paul attributes fellowship among believers to the Holy Spirit, not the Father or the Son.
1. David's cry for the Holy Spirit to not depart from him in Psalm 51:11 can be better understood when read in light of the Holy Spirit having anointed King Saul but also leaving him in 1 Samuel 16:13.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Therefore, when the Holy Spirit is working strongly in the church to manifest God's presence, the church community will be in beautiful harmony and overflowing with love for one another.* (782)
