##### What I learned:
1. *[Genesis 5:2](Genesis5#v.2) specifically describes God's activity of choosing a name that would apply to the human race as whole.* (564)
1. Growing in Christian maturity is to grow in greater likeness to God.
1. Primogeniture is the idea that the firstborn in a human family has leadership/headship.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *New Testament commands concerning marriage do no perpetuate any elements of the curse or any sinful behavior patterns; they rather reaffirm the order and distinction of roles that were there from the beginning of God's good creation.* (591)

##### What I learned:
1. Monism is a view not adopted by evangelical theologians
1. Soul and spirit are used interchangeably throughout Scripture to refer to the immaterial side of people.
1. The origin of the soul has been a topic of debate in church historyâ€”Creationism versus Traducianism.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Moreover, a healthy emphasis on dichotomy within an overall unity reminds us that Christian growth must include all aspects of our lives. We are continually to "cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit,  bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God" ([2 Cor 7:1](2Cor7#v.1)). We are to be =="increasing in the knowledge of God"== ([Col. 1:10](Colossians1#v.9-11)), and our ==emotions and desires are to conform increasingly to the "desires of the Spirit"== ([Gal 5:17](Galatians5.md#v.17)), including an increase in godly emotions such as peace, joy, love, and so forth ([Gal. 5:22](Galatians5.md#v.22-23)).* (611)

##### What I learned:
1. The root of sin lies in its distortion of our answers to three questions: what is true? What is right? Who am I?
1. All sin is ultimately irrational.
1. When Christians sin, their legal standing before God is unchanged but God becomes displeased in us.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In both cases Jesus distinguishes between lesser and greater commandments, implying that some sins are worse than other sins in terms of God's evaluation of their importance.* (632)

##### What I learned:
1. According to [Romans 3:25](Romans3#v.25), God punishes sin since God's righteousness demands it. Christ had to pay for the previous sins for those in the Old Testament since sacrifice of animals could not take away sins ([Hebrews 10:4](Hebrews10#v.4)).
1. [Hosea 6:7](Hosea6#v.7) proves Adam was in covenant with God even though it was not an explicit covenant. It had all the components of a covenant.
1. [Galatians 3:8](Galatians3#v.8) says that Abraham had the gospel preached to him!
2. Old Covenant only refers to the Mosaic Covenant of the law. According to covenant theology, the Noahic, Abrahamic, and Davidic covenant were "covenants of grace". 
3. Jesus will be a man forever since He will return in the same way ([Acts 1:11](Acts1#v.11))).

##### Interesting Quote:
- *...God put mankind on the earth to subdue t and rule over it as God's representatives. But mankind did not fulfill that purpose but fell into sin. The author of Hebrews realizes that ==God intended everything to be in subjection to man==, but he admits, "At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him" (Heb. 2:8). Then when Jesus came as a man, ==he was able to obey God and thereby have the right to rule over creation as a man, thus fulfilling God's original purpose in putting man on the earth.==* (676)
