##### What I learned:
1. Terms
	1. Systematic Theology is any study that answers the question, "What does the Bible teach us today?" about any given topic.
	2. Historical Theology is the historical study of how Christians in different periods have understood various theological topics.
	3. Philosophical Theology studies theological topics largely without use of the Bible. They instead use philosophical reasoning and what can be known about God from observing the universe.
	4. Apologetics is providing a defense for the truthfulness of the Christian faith for the purpose of convincing unbelievers.
	5. Biblical Theology gives special attention to the teachings of individual authors and sections of Scripture and to the place of each teaching in the historical development of Scripture.
1. Doctrine is what the whole Bible teaches us today about some particular topic.
2. Christian ethics differ from systematic theology as the former focuses on what God wants us to do and what attitude we should have; the latter focuses on what we should believe and know.
3. Major doctrines are major since they have a more significant impact on our thinking about other doctrines and how we live the Christian life.
4. Psalm 119:18 is a prayer to understand God's Word.
5. James 1:19-20 teaches we ought to steward our knowledge of theology with humility and love. Don't study to win arguments or make another believer feel insignificant in the Lord's work.
6. Christian theology can tolerate paradox but God never asks us to believe a contradiction. Example is "God is three persons and one God" while a contradiction is "God is three persons and God is NOT three persons."

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The basic reason for studying systematic theology, then, is that it enables us to teach ourselves and others what the Bible says, thus fulfilling the "teaching" part of the Great Commission.* (9)
- ===*No matter how intelligent a student might be, if the student does not continue to pray for God to give him or her an understanding mind and a believing and humble heart, and the student does not maintain a personal walk with the Lord,=== then the teachings of Scripture will be misunderstood and disbelieved, doctrinal error will result, and the mind and heart of the student will not be changed for the better but for the worse.* (17)
- *Systematic theology rightly studied will not lead to knowledge that "puffs up" (1 Cor. 8:1) but to humility and love for others.* (18).

> So they tore down the altar and stored the stones in a convenient place on the temple hill until there should come a prophet to tell what to do with them"
> 1 Maccabees 4:45-46

>such as had not been since the time that prophets ceased to appear among them.
2. The verses above shows that author knew of no one who could speak with the authority of God as the OT prophets had done. 
3. Josephus admits that the later writings, now known as the Apocrypha, were not of "equal credit" to the OT. He also records in 95 A.D. that the Jewish people had not dared to alter a syllable in what they called the "Scriptures" for long ages. 
4. Jerome included the Apocryph in the Vulgate while admitting they were not "books of the canon" but merely "books of the church."
