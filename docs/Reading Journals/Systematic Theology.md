##### What I learned:
1. Even animals and plants depend on God (Job 12:10)
1. Pantheism implies God has no distinct personality which means He is not holy. It also destroys the personal identity of humans as well.
1. Dualism says God and the Universe have eternally co-existed.

	##### Interesting:
1. Belief that world was created in 4004 B.C. which was the major proponenet of Young Earth creationists was popularized by Irish archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656).

##### What I learned:
1. Proponents of theistic evolution propose Adam and Eve were just two humans chosen out of an original 10,000 original humans of the human species.
2. Nature longs to be freed from its bondage of natural disasters, thorns and thistles, weeds, and such in much the same way we long to be freed from our physical bodies and obtain new resurrection bodies. (Romans 8:18-21)
3. *The evidence from creation for God's existence is so overwhelming that God holds people morally accountable for denying it.* (pg. 381)

##### Interesting:
1. All sin is ultimately irrational at its root.

##### What I learned:
1. There is no gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2. Gap theory falls apart when we realize God will have looked at all the demonic beings and call His creation "very good."
1. Biblical geneologies have gaps in them which opens up the possibility of an older Earth.
1. There is much debate over whether *yom* in Genesis 1 is a literal twenty-four hour day or a long period of time.

##### Interesting Quote:
1. *Humans are beneficiaries of the remains of millions of generations of plants and animals that preceded us.* (pg 395)

##### What I learned:
1. There is a possibiliy the sun, moon, and stars were made before the first day but were made visible or revealed on day four. This is good a response to Mr. Heaton's argument of how plants can't go without the sun for too long.
1. Mature creationism falls short in explaining fossils. Did God originally create fossils within the earth to simply make people think the earth was older than it really was?
1. Young earth proponents fail to distinguish scientific arguments for creation by design from scientific arguments differing on the age of the earth.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *The material universe is good in itself, for God created it good and wants us to use it in ways pleasing to him. Therefore we should seek to be like the early Christians, who "received their food with glad and generous hearts" (Acts 2:46), always with thanksgiving to God for his provisions.* (page 413)
