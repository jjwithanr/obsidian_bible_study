1. Dualism says God and the Universe have eternally co-existed.

##### Interesting Quote:
1. Belief that world was created in 4004 B.C. which was the major proponenet of Young Earth creationists was popularized by Irish archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656).

##### What I learned:
1. Proponents of theistic evolution propose Adam and Eve were just two humans chosen out of an original 10,000 original humans of the human species.
2. Nature longs to be freed from its bondage of natural disasters, thorns and thistles, weeds, and such in much the same way we long to be freed from our physical bodies and obtain new resurrection bodies. (Romans 8:18-21)
3. *The evidence from creation for God's existence is so overwhelming that God holds people morally accountable for denying it.* (pg. 381)

##### Interesting Quote:
1. All sin is ultimately irrational at its root.

##### What I learned:
1. There is no gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2. Gap theory falls apart when we realize God will have looked at all the demonic beings and call His creation "very good."
1. Biblical geneologies have gaps in them which opens up the possibility of an older Earth.
1. There is much debate over whether *yom* in Genesis 1 is a literal twenty-four hour day or a long period of time.

##### Interesting Quote:
1. *Humans are beneficiaries of the remains of millions of generations of plants and animals that preceded us.* (pg 395)
