##### What I learned:
1. Even animals and plants depend on God (Job 12:10)
1. Pantheism implies God has no distinct personality which means He is not holy. It also destroys the personal identity of humans as well.
1. Dualism says God and the Universe have eternally co-existed.

	##### Interesting:
1. Belief that world was created in 4004 B.C. which was the major proponenet of Young Earth creationists was popularized by Irish archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656).

##### What I learned:
1. Proponents of theistic evolution propose Adam and Eve were just two humans chosen out of an original 10,000 original humans of the human species.
2. Nature longs to be freed from its bondage of natural disasters, thorns and thistles, weeds, and such in much the same way we long to be freed from our physical bodies and obtain new resurrection bodies. (Romans 8:18-21)
3. *The evidence from creation for God's existence is so overwhelming that God holds people morally accountable for denying it.* (pg. 381)

##### Interesting:
1. All sin is ultimately irrational at its root.

##### What I learned:
1. There is no gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2. Gap theory falls apart when we realize God will have looked at all the demonic beings and call His creation "very good."
1. Biblical geneologies have gaps in them which opens up the possibility of an older Earth.
1. There is much debate over whether *yom* in Genesis 1 is a literal twenty-four hour day or a long period of time.

##### Interesting Quote:
1. *Humans are beneficiaries of the remains of millions of generations of plants and animals that preceded us.* (pg 395)

##### What I learned:
1. There is a possibiliy the sun, moon, and stars were made before the first day but were made visible or revealed on day four. This is good a response to Mr. Heaton's argument of how plants can't go without the sun for too long.
1. Mature creationism falls short in explaining fossils. Did God originally create fossils within the earth to simply make people think the earth was older than it really was?
1. Young earth proponents fail to distinguish scientific arguments for creation by design from scientific arguments differing on the age of the earth.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *The material universe is good in itself, for God created it good and wants us to use it in ways pleasing to him. Therefore we should seek to be like the early Christians, who "received their food with glad and generous hearts" (Acts 2:46), always with thanksgiving to God for his provisions.* (page 413)

##### What I learned:
1. God's providence provides a basis for science: God has made an continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways. (page 422)
2. Natural events are fully caused by God and fully caused by creation. 
3. Scripturally, God has indirectly brought about some kind of evil.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *But we are nonetheless free in the greatest sense that any creature of God could be freeâ€”we make willing choices, choices that have real effects. We are aware of no restraints on our will fro mGod when we make decisions. We must insist that we have the power of willing choice; otherwise we will fall into the error fatalism or determinism and thus conclude that our choices do not matter or that we cannot really make willing choices.* (page 438)

##### What I learned:
1. Grudem really breaks down many common strawman arguments against Calvinism: *To say that God does not react to our actions is to deny the whole history of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.* (page 453)
1. Calvinism asserts the mystery of the doctrine of God's providence in light of the fact that God ordains that people do wrong yet continually places the blame for that wrong on the individual human beings who does wrong and never on God himself.
3. A repeated rebuttal to Arminian stances is the lack of explicit Scriptural to justify the paradoxical aspects of the doctrine of God's providence. Grudem claims to hold an Arminian position, one relies more on human experience and intuition rather than specific texts of Scripture.  

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *This causes us to conclude that God has made us in such a way that (1) he ordains all that we do, and (2) we exercise our personal will and make real, voluntary choices. Because we cannot understand this, should we therefore reject it?* (page 452)


#### 2022-07-11 22:53 Pages 460-580
##### What I learned:
1. If the Arminian God has to allow for a freedom to choose evil, it implies God will have to allow the possibility of sinful choices in heaven eternally.
2. The two unanswered questions of Calvinism are "Exactly how can God not be blamed for evil when he ordains that we do evil willingly?" and "Exactly how can God cause us to choose something willingly?"
3. The church in Galatia also had members working miracles as implied in Galatians 3:5.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Therefore, even if we understand the "signs of an apostle" to be miracles, we should recognize that those who use this passage to argue that miracles cannot be done through Christians today are taking the phrase "signs of an apostle" out of its context and using it in a way that Paul never intended.* (478)
