1. Even animals and plants depend on God (Job 12:10)
1. Pantheism implies God has no distinct personality which means He is not holy. It also destroys the personal identity of humans as well.
1. Dualism says God and the Universe have eternally co-existed.

##### Interesting:

##### What I learned:
1. Proponents of theistic evolution propose Adam and Eve were just two humans chosen out of an original 10,000 original humans of the human species.
2. Nature longs to be freed from its bondage of natural disasters, thorns and thistles, weeds, and such in much the same way we long to be freed from our physical bodies and obtain new resurrection bodies. (Romans 8:18-21)
3. *The evidence from creation for God's existence is so overwhelming that God holds people morally accountable for denying it.* (pg. 381).

##### Interesting:
1. All sin is ultimately irrational at its root.
