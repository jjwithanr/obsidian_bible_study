#### 2022-07-05 21:51 Pages 340-360
##### What I learned:
1. Even animals and plants depend on God (Job 12:10)
1. Pantheism implies God has no distinct personality which means He is not holy. It also destroys the personal identity of humans as well.
1. Dualism says God and the Universe have eternally co-existed.

	##### Interesting:
1. Belief that world was created in 4004 B.C. which was the major proponenet of Young Earth creationists was popularized by Irish archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656).

##### What I learned:
1. Proponents of theistic evolution propose Adam and Eve were just two humans chosen out of an original 10,000 original humans of the human species.
2. Nature longs to be freed from its bondage of natural disasters, thorns and thistles, weeds, and such in much the same way we long to be freed from our physical bodies and obtain new resurrection bodies. (Romans 8:18-21)
3. *The evidence from creation for God's existence is so overwhelming that God holds people morally accountable for denying it.* (pg. 381)

##### Interesting:
1. All sin is ultimately irrational at its root.


#### 2022-07-07 21:19 Pages 380-400
##### What I learned:
1. There is no gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2. Gap theory falls apart when we realize God will have looked at all the demonic beings and call His creation "very good."
1. Biblical geneologies have gaps in them which opens up the possibility of an older Earth.
1. There is much debate over whether *yom* in Genesis 1 is a literal twenty-four hour day or a long period of time.

##### Interesting Quote:
1. *Humans are beneficiaries of the remains of millions of generations of plants and animals that preceded us.* (pg 395)


#### 2022-07-08 21:50 Pages 400-420
##### What I learned:
1. There is a possibiliy the sun, moon, and stars were made before the first day but were made visible or revealed on day four. This is good a response to Mr. Heaton's argument of how plants can't go without the sun for too long.
1. Mature creationism falls short in explaining fossils. Did God originally create fossils within the earth to simply make people think the earth was older than it really was?
1. Young earth proponents fail to distinguish scientific arguments for creation by design from scientific arguments differing on the age of the earth.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *The material universe is good in itself, for God created it good and wants us to use it in ways pleasing to him. Therefore we should seek to be like the early Christians, who "received their food with glad and generous hearts" (Acts 2:46), always with thanksgiving to God for his provisions.* (page 413)


#### 2022-07-09 11:21 Pages 420-440
##### What I learned:
1. God's providence provides a basis for science: God has made an continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways. (page 422)
2. Natural events are fully caused by God and fully caused by creation. 
3. Scripturally, God has indirectly brought about some kind of evil.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *But we are nonetheless free in the greatest sense that any creature of God could be free—we make willing choices, choices that have real effects. We are aware of no restraints on our will fro mGod when we make decisions. We must insist that we have the power of willing choice; otherwise we will fall into the error fatalism or determinism and thus conclude that our choices do not matter or that we cannot really make willing choices.* (page 438)


#### 2022-07-10 22:09 Pages 440-460
##### What I learned:
1. Grudem really breaks down many common strawman arguments against Calvinism: *To say that God does not react to our actions is to deny the whole history of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.* (page 453)
1. Calvinism asserts the mystery of the doctrine of God's providence in light of the fact that God ordains that people do wrong yet continually places the blame for that wrong on the individual human beings who does wrong and never on God himself.
3. A repeated rebuttal to Arminian stances is the lack of explicit Scriptural to justify the paradoxical aspects of the doctrine of God's providence. Grudem claims to hold an Arminian position, one relies more on human experience and intuition rather than specific texts of Scripture.  

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *This causes us to conclude that God has made us in such a way that (1) he ordains all that we do, and (2) we exercise our personal will and make real, voluntary choices. Because we cannot understand this, should we therefore reject it?* (page 452)


#### 2022-07-11 22:53 Pages 460-480
##### What I learned:
1. If the Arminian God has to allow for a freedom to choose evil, it implies God will have to allow the possibility of sinful choices in heaven eternally.
2. The two unanswered questions of Calvinism are "Exactly how can God not be blamed for evil when he ordains that we do evil willingly?" and "Exactly how can God cause us to choose something willingly?"
3. The church in Galatia also had members working miracles as implied in Galatians 3:5.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Therefore, even if we understand the "signs of an apostle" to be miracles, we should recognize that those who use this passage to argue that miracles cannot be done through Christians today are taking the phrase "signs of an apostle" out of its context and using it in a way that Paul never intended.* (478)


#### 2022-07-12 17:15 Pages 480-500
##### What I learned:
1. Claims that God can intend miracles to be worked in stages undermines claims that miracles must be always be successful, immediate, without relapse, and confirming of God's messenger.
2. After Pentecost, the early church prayed for boldness to preach the gospel AND for God to grant miracles to accompany its preaching (Acts 4:29-30).
3. Praying in Jesus' name is a prayer made on his authorization and in a way that is consistent with his character.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The identity of these workers of false miracles is always known through their denial of the gospel. There is no indication anywhere in Scripture that genuine Christians with the Holy Spirit in them will work false miracles.* (485)


#### 2022-07-14 21:40 Pages 500-540
##### What I learned:
1. Grudem interprets the groans in Romans 8:28 coming from a person and not in tongues. 
2. Jesus encourages us to have his words within us as we pray (John 15:7)
3. When God forgives us when we forgive others, this is to restore our day-to-day relationship with him—this is different from our initial experience of forgiveness when we are justified by faith.
4. The early church practiced fasting as routine for seeking the Lord's guidance for appointing church officers (Acts 14:23).
5. Angels were created beings (possibly during the first day) and were not spared when they sinned (2 Peter 2:4).
6. Knowing there are angelic witnesses serve to deter us from disobeying the Lord in their presence (1 Tim 5:21; 1 Cor 4:9).
7. Demons cannot read our minds or know our thoughts, but they can observe what goes on in the world and draw conclunsions from such observations (explaining fortune-tellers, witchcraft).

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In many places in the Old Testament, the Lord shows himself to be the true God in distinction from the false (demonic) gods of the nations by the fact that he alone can know the future: "I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done" (Isa. 46:9-10).* (537)


#### 2022-07-15 22:02 Pages 540-560
##### What I learned:
1. *Jesus explains that his power over demons is a distinguishing mark on his ministry to inaugurate the reign of the kingdom of God among mankind in a new and powerful way:* Matthew 12:28-29 (540)
2. Grudem pushes back on SAFA's core vision: *in no instance does anyone in the New Testament...teach by word or example that ceratin "demonic strongholds" over a city have to be broken before the gospel can be proclaimed with effectiveness. Rather, Christians just preach the gospel, and it comes with power to change lives!* (542-543)
3. The result of satanic or demonic activity is destroying parts of God's creation and those made in the image of God.
4. Phillip wasn't an apostle.
5. Rebukes against demons would have to be spoken audibly given that demons cannot read our minds—only God can.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *\[on Mark 9:29\] He must have meant, rather, that a continual life of prayer and abiding in God will result in a spiritual preparedness and possession of a spiritual power through the anointing of the Holy Spirit that will be effective in conflict even over very severe demonic attack or influence.* (555)


#### 2022-07-17 15:53 Pages 560-600
##### What I learned:
1. *Genesis 5:2 specifically describes God's activity of choosing a name that would apply to the human race as whole.* (564)
1. Growing in Christian maturity is to grow in greater likeness to God.
1. Primogeniture is the idea that the firstborn in a human family has leadership/headship.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *New Testament commands concerning marriage do no perpetuate any elements of the curse or any sinful behavior pattersn; they rather reaffirm the order and distinction of roles that were there from the beginning of God's good creation.* (591)


#### 2022-07-18 20:26 Pages 600-620
##### What I learned:
1. Monism is a view not adopted by evangelical theologians
1. Soul and spirit are used interchangably throughout Scripture to refer to the immaterial side of people.
1. The origin of the soul has been a topic of debate in church history—Creationism versus Traducianism.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Moreover, a healthy emphasis on dichotomy within an overall unity reminds us that Christian growth must include all aspects of our lives. We are continually to "cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit,  bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God" (2 Cor 7:1). We are to be =="increasing in the knowledge of God"== (Col. 1:10), and our ==emotions and desires are to conform increasingly to the "desires of the Spirit"== (Gal 5:17), including an increase in godly emotions such as peace, joy, love, and so forth (Gal. 5:22).* (611)


#### 2022-07-21 20:58 Pages 620-640
##### What I learned:
1. The root of sin lies in its distortion of our answers to three questions: what is true? What is right? Who am I?
1. All sin ultimately irrational.
1. When Christians sin, their legal standing before God is unchanged but God becomes displeased in us.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In both cases Jesus distinguishes between lesser and greater commandments, implying that some sins are worse than other sins in terms of God's evaluation of their importance.* (632)


#### 2022-07-21 21:03 Pages 640-680
##### What I learned:
1. According to Romans 3:25, God punishes sin since God's righteousness demands it. Christ had to pay for the previous sins for those in the Old Testament since sacrifice of animals could not take away sins (Hebrews 10:4).
1. Hosea 6:7 proves Adam was in covenant with God even though it was not an explicit covenant. It had all the components of a covenant.
1. Galatians 3:8 says that Abraham had the gospel preached to him!
2. Old Covenant only refers to the Mosaic Covenant of the law. According to covenant theology, the Noahic, Abrahamic, and Davidic covenant were "covenants of grace". 
3. Jesus will be a man forever since He will return in the same way (Acts 1:11).

##### Interesting Quote:
- *...God put mankind on the earth to subdue t and rule over it as God's representatives. But mankind did not fulfill that purpose but fell into sin. The author of Hebrews realizes that ==God intended everything to be in subjection to man==, but he admits, "At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him" (Heb. 2:8). Then when Jesus came as a man, ==he was able to obey God and thereby have the right to rule over creation as a man, thus fulfilling God's original purpose in putting man on the earth.==* (676)


#### 2022-07-22 21:37 Pages 680-720
##### What I learned:
1. John 2:19 indicates Jesus himself was active in his resurrection in addition to God the Father.
1. To avoid kenosis theology, it is important to interpret "Christ emptying himself" as a change of role or status, not essential attributes or nature.
1. Jesus had two distinct wills (human will and divine will) that belonged to His two distinct natures. It is important to understand this knowing that whatever Christ did, the person of Christ did as a whole being.
2. Luke 24:25-26 supports the necessity for Christ to suffer and die to atone for all our sins.
3. Grudem dissects the Greek to show that Jesus was continually being tempted throughout his forty day fast in the wilderness.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *If Jesus if not fully God, we have no salvation and ultimately no Christianity.* (690)


#### 2022-07-25 17:26 Pages 720-760
##### What I learned:
1. The "descended into hell" phrase at the end of the Apostle's Creed has caused a lot misunderstanding in whether Jesus went to hell after he was crucified. Grudem supports removing it from the Apostle's Creed.
1. We can interpret 1 Peter 3:19-20 the way Augustine proposed: *When Noah was building the ark, Christ "in spirit" was preaching through Noah to the hostile unbelievers around him.*
1. Particular redemption seeks to avoid the doctrinal error that everyone is saved if "Christ died for the world." Grudem admits unbelievers generally avoid such error when hearing that statement however.
2. 1 Cor 15:20-23 shows that we will also have raised bodies like Christ since "He is the firstfruit" of future resurrection of the saints.
3. Jesus' post-resurrection body was unique in that his bodily scars were retained to serve as an eternal reminder of his work on the cross. For us, we will be made whole and fully healed.
4. Heaven exists as a place in the space-time universe, in contrary to what Gargarin said as the first astronaut in space.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Paul knew that even in this life the resurrection of Christ gave new power for Christian ministry and obedience to God.* (755) on [[Philippians3#v 10]]
