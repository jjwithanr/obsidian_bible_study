#### 2022-07-05 21:51 Pages 340-360
##### What I learned:
1. Even animals and plants depend on God (Job 12:10)
1. Pantheism implies God has no distinct personality which means He is not holy. It also destroys the personal identity of humans as well.
1. Dualism says God and the Universe have eternally co-existed.

##### Interesting:
1. Belief that world was created in 4004 B.C. which was the major proponenet of Young Earth creationists was popularized by Irish archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656).


#### 2022-07-06 21:14 Pages 360-380
##### What I learned:
1. Proponents of theistic evolution propose Adam and Eve were just two humans chosen out of an original 10,000 original humans of the human species.
2. Nature longs to be freed from its bondage of natural disasters, thorns and thistles, weeds, and such in much the same way we long to be freed from our physical bodies and obtain new resurrection bodies. (Romans 8:18-21)
3. *The evidence from creation for God's existence is so overwhelming that God holds people morally accountable for denying it.* (381)

##### Interesting:
1. All sin is ultimately irrational at its root.


#### 2022-07-07 21:19 Pages 380-400
##### What I learned:
1. There is no gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2. Gap theory falls apart when we realize God will have looked at all the demonic beings and call His creation "very good."
1. Biblical geneologies have gaps in them which opens up the possibility of an older Earth.
1. There is much debate over whether *yom* in Genesis 1 is a literal twenty-four hour day or a long period of time.

##### Interesting Quote:
1. *Humans are beneficiaries of the remains of millions of generations of plants and animals that preceded us.* (395)


#### 2022-07-08 21:50 Pages 400-420
##### What I learned:
1. There is a possibiliy the sun, moon, and stars were made before the first day but were made visible or revealed on day four. This is good a response to Mr. Heaton's argument of how plants can't go without the sun for too long.
1. Mature creationism falls short in explaining fossils. Did God originally create fossils within the earth to simply make people think the earth was older than it really was?
1. Young earth proponents fail to distinguish scientific arguments for creation by design from scientific arguments differing on the age of the earth.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *The material universe is good in itself, for God created it good and wants us to use it in ways pleasing to him. Therefore we should seek to be like the early Christians, who "received their food with glad and generous hearts" (Acts 2:46), always with thanksgiving to God for his provisions.* (413)


#### 2022-07-09 11:21 Pages 420-440
##### What I learned:
1. God's providence provides a basis for science: God has made an continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways. (422)
2. Natural events are fully caused by God and fully caused by creation. 
3. Scripturally, God has indirectly brought about some kind of evil.

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *But we are nonetheless free in the greatest sense that any creature of God could be free—we make willing choices, choices that have real effects. We are aware of no restraints on our will from God when we make decisions. We must insist that we have the power of willing choice; otherwise we will fall into the error fatalism or determinism and thus conclude that our choices do not matter or that we cannot really make willing choices.* (page 438)


#### 2022-07-10 22:09 Pages 440-460
##### What I learned:
1. Grudem really breaks down many common strawman arguments against Calvinism: *To say that God does not react to our actions is to deny the whole history of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.* (453)
1. Calvinism asserts the mystery of the doctrine of God's providence in light of the fact that God ordains that people do wrong yet continually places the blame for that wrong on the individual human beings who does wrong and never on God himself.
3. A repeated rebuttal to Arminianism is their lack of explicit Scriptural to justify the paradoxical aspects of God's providence. Grudem claims that to hold an Arminian position, one relies more on human experience and intuition rather than specific texts of Scripture.  

##### Interesting Quote:
1.  *This causes us to conclude that God has made us in such a way that (1) he ordains all that we do, and (2) we exercise our personal will and make real, voluntary choices. Because we cannot understand this, should we therefore reject it?* (452)


#### 2022-07-11 22:53 Pages 460-480
##### What I learned:
1. If the Arminian God has to allow for a freedom to choose evil, it implies God will have to allow the possibility of sinful choices in heaven eternally.
2. The two unanswered questions of Calvinism are "Exactly how can God not be blamed for evil when he ordains that we do evil willingly?" and "Exactly how can God cause us to choose something willingly?"
3. The church in Galatia also had members working miracles as implied in Galatians 3:5.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Therefore, even if we understand the "signs of an apostle" to be miracles, we should recognize that those who use this passage to argue that miracles cannot be done through Christians today are taking the phrase "signs of an apostle" out of its context and using it in a way that Paul never intended.* (478)


#### 2022-07-12 17:15 Pages 480-500
##### What I learned:
1. Claims that God can intend miracles to be worked in stages undermines claims that miracles must be always be successful, immediate, without relapse, and confirming of God's messenger.
2. After Pentecost, the early church prayed for boldness to preach the gospel AND for God to grant miracles to accompany its preaching (Acts 4:29-30).
3. Praying in Jesus' name is a prayer made on his authorization and in a way that is consistent with his character.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The identity of these workers of false miracles is always known through their denial of the gospel. There is no indication anywhere in Scripture that genuine Christians with the Holy Spirit in them will work false miracles.* (485)


#### 2022-07-14 21:40 Pages 500-540
##### What I learned:
1. Grudem interprets the groans in Romans 8:28 coming from a person and not in tongues. 
2. Jesus encourages us to have his words within us as we pray (John 15:7)
3. When God forgives us when we forgive others, this is to restore our day-to-day relationship with him—this is different from our initial experience of forgiveness when we are justified by faith.
4. The early church practiced fasting as routine for seeking the Lord's guidance for appointing church officers (Acts 14:23).
5. Angels were created beings (possibly during the first day) and were not spared when they sinned (2 Peter 2:4).
6. Knowing there are angelic witnesses present in our lives serve as an additional deterrence from disobeying the Lord (1 Tim 5:21; 1 Cor 4:9).
7. Demons cannot read our minds or know our thoughts, but they can observe what goes on in the world and draw conclunsions from such observations (explaining fortune-tellers, witchcraft).

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In many places in the Old Testament, the Lord shows himself to be the true God in distinction from the false (demonic) gods of the nations by the fact that he alone can know the future: "I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done" (Isa. 46:9-10).* (537)


#### 2022-07-15 22:02 Pages 540-560
##### What I learned:
1. *Jesus explains that his power over demons is a distinguishing mark on his ministry to inaugurate the reign of the kingdom of God among mankind in a new and powerful way:* Matthew 12:28-29 (540)
2. Grudem pushes back on SAFA's core vision: *in no instance does anyone in the New Testament...teach by word or example that ceratin "demonic strongholds" over a city have to be broken before the gospel can be proclaimed with effectiveness. Rather, Christians just preach the gospel, and it comes with power to change lives!* (542-543)
3. The result of satanic or demonic activity is destroying parts of God's creation and those made in the image of God.
4. Phillip wasn't an apostle.
5. Rebukes against demons would have to be spoken audibly given that demons cannot read our minds—only God can.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *\[on Mark 9:29\] He must have meant, rather, that a continual life of prayer and abiding in God will result in a spiritual preparedness and possession of a spiritual power through the anointing of the Holy Spirit that will be effective in conflict even over very severe demonic attack or influence.* (555)


#### 2022-07-17 15:53 Pages 560-600
##### What I learned:
1. *Genesis 5:2 specifically describes God's activity of choosing a name that would apply to the human race as whole.* (564)
1. Growing in Christian maturity is to grow in greater likeness to God.
1. Primogeniture is the idea that the firstborn in a human family has leadership/headship.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *New Testament commands concerning marriage do no perpetuate any elements of the curse or any sinful behavior pattersn; they rather reaffirm the order and distinction of roles that were there from the beginning of God's good creation.* (591)


#### 2022-07-18 20:26 Pages 600-620
##### What I learned:
1. Monism is a view not adopted by evangelical theologians
1. Soul and spirit are used interchangably throughout Scripture to refer to the immaterial side of people.
1. The origin of the soul has been a topic of debate in church history—Creationism versus Traducianism.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Moreover, a healthy emphasis on dichotomy within an overall unity reminds us that Christian growth must include all aspects of our lives. We are continually to "cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit,  bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God" (2 Cor 7:1). We are to be =="increasing in the knowledge of God"== (Col. 1:10), and our ==emotions and desires are to conform increasingly to the "desires of the Spirit"== (Gal 5:17), including an increase in godly emotions such as peace, joy, love, and so forth (Gal. 5:22).* (611)


#### 2022-07-21 20:58 Pages 620-640
##### What I learned:
1. The root of sin lies in its distortion of our answers to three questions: what is true? What is right? Who am I?
1. All sin ultimately irrational.
1. When Christians sin, their legal standing before God is unchanged but God becomes displeased in us.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In both cases Jesus distinguishes between lesser and greater commandments, implying that some sins are worse than other sins in terms of God's evaluation of their importance.* (632)


#### 2022-07-21 21:03 Pages 640-680
##### What I learned:
1. According to Romans 3:25, God punishes sin since God's righteousness demands it. Christ had to pay for the previous sins for those in the Old Testament since sacrifice of animals could not take away sins (Hebrews 10:4).
1. Hosea 6:7 proves Adam was in covenant with God even though it was not an explicit covenant. It had all the components of a covenant.
1. Galatians 3:8 says that Abraham had the gospel preached to him!
2. Old Covenant only refers to the Mosaic Covenant of the law. According to covenant theology, the Noahic, Abrahamic, and Davidic covenant were "covenants of grace". 
3. Jesus will be a man forever since He will return in the same way (Acts 1:11).

##### Interesting Quote:
- *...God put mankind on the earth to subdue t and rule over it as God's representatives. But mankind did not fulfill that purpose but fell into sin. The author of Hebrews realizes that ==God intended everything to be in subjection to man==, but he admits, "At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him" (Heb. 2:8). Then when Jesus came as a man, ==he was able to obey God and thereby have the right to rule over creation as a man, thus fulfilling God's original purpose in putting man on the earth.==* (676)


#### 2022-07-22 21:37 Pages 680-720
##### What I learned:
1. John 2:19 indicates Jesus himself was active in his resurrection in addition to God the Father.
1. To avoid kenosis theology, it is important to interpret "Christ emptying himself" as a change of role or status, not essential attributes or nature.
1. Jesus had two distinct wills (human will and divine will) that belonged to His two distinct natures. It is important to understand this knowing that whatever Christ did, the person of Christ did as a whole being.
2. Luke 24:25-26 supports the necessity for Christ to suffer and die to atone for all our sins.
3. Grudem dissects the Greek to show that Jesus was continually being tempted throughout his forty day fast in the wilderness.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *If Jesus if not fully God, we have no salvation and ultimately no Christianity.* (690)


#### 2022-07-25 17:26 Pages 720-760
##### What I learned:
1. The "descended into hell" phrase at the end of the Apostle's Creed has caused a lot misunderstanding in whether Jesus went to hell after he was crucified. Grudem supports removing it from the Apostle's Creed.
1. We can interpret 1 Peter 3:19-20 the way Augustine proposed: *When Noah was building the ark, Christ "in spirit" was preaching through Noah to the hostile unbelievers around him.*
1. Particular redemption seeks to avoid the doctrinal error that everyone is saved if "Christ died for the world." Grudem admits unbelievers generally avoid such error when hearing that statement however.
2. 1 Cor 15:20-23 shows that we will also have raised bodies like Christ since "He is the firstfruit" of future resurrection of the saints.
3. Jesus' post-resurrection body was unique in that his bodily scars were retained to serve as an eternal reminder of his work on the cross. For us, we will be made whole and fully healed.
4. Heaven exists as a place in the space-time universe, in contrary to what Gargarin said as the first astronaut in space.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Paul knew that even in this life the resurrection of Christ gave new power for Christian ministry and obedience to God.* (755) on [[Philippians3#v 10]]


#### 2022-07-26 18:23 Pages 760-780
##### What I learned:
1. Christ's session refers to the fact that he sat down at the right hand of God. Session is no longer used this way in English.
1. Christ's ascension means we are able to share now in Christ's authority over the universe and will later share in it more fully.
1. Jesus is truly and fully a prophet but NT avoids calling him that because Jesus himself is the subject of all the OT prophecies and is himself the source of revelation from God.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Of course, since he is fully God, the being of the Holy Spirit is always present everywhere (he is omnipresent), but he does not always show his presence in activities that bring blessing* (779)


#### 2022-07-28 20:45 Pages 780-800
##### What I learned:
1. The Holy Spirit has some restraining influence on unbelievers since he convicts the world of sin (John 16:8-11).
1. 2 Corinthians 13:14 shows that Paul attributes fellowship among believers to the Holy Spirit, not the Father or the Son.
1. David's cry for the Holy Spirit to not depart from him in Psalm 51:11 can be better understood when read in light of the Holy Spirit having anointed King Saul but also leaving him in 1 Samuel 16:13.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Therefore, when the Holy Spirit is working strongly in the church to manifest God's presence, the church community will be in beautiful harmony and overflowing with love for one another.* (782)



#### 2022-07-29 22:09 Pages 800-840
##### What I learned:
1. One restraint that common grace bestows is the force of conscience as noted in Romans 2:14-15. This shows that although their moral behavior cannot grant them salvation, unbelievers are capable of "doing good" according to Luke 6:33.
1. Adam and Eve remained married after the fall and bore children, creating the first family. The existence of families in unbelievers is evidence of common grace.
1. It is biblical to seek good for unbelievers according to Matthew 5:45 where God bestows rain on the just and the unjust. Jesus did not require anyone to believe first in order to receive healing from him.
2. God shows goodness even to unbelievers as evident in Psalm 145:9 and Mark 10:21.
3. 1 Corinthians 8:3 hits diff.
4. God's highest value is His own glory, according to the Reformed view, while Arminians believe His highest value is the libertarian free will of man.
5. Even John Calvin cringed at the doctrine of reprobation. Reprobation brings God sorrow.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *This means that all science and technology carried out by non-Christians is a result of common grace...* (805)
- *Berkhof says that God "showers untold blessings upon all men and also clearly indicates that these are the expressions of a favorable disposition in God, which falls short however of the positive volition to pardon their sin, to lift their sentence, and to grant them salvation."* (810)
- *Another important decision is that the ground of election is God's grace, whereas the ground of reprobation is God's justice.* (835)
- *But why did he decide to set his love on me? Not for anything good in me, but simply because he decided to love me. There is more ultimate reason than that.* (836)


#### 2022-07-30 12:33 Pages 840-860
##### What I learned:
1. All genuine gospel presentations must include repentance and forgiveness of sins.
1. We play not active role in God's work of regeneration. Regeneration comes before saving faith.
1. Jesus didn't refer to Christian baptism in John 3:5 since that started on Pentecost.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *This is why prayer is so important to effective evangelism. Unless God works in people's hearts to make the proclamation of the gospel effective, there will be no genuine saving response.* (843)


#### 2022-07-31 22:34 Pages 860-880
##### What I learned:
1. Using the word trust is describe saving faith is more accurate than faith or belief in today's English.
1. Free Grace theology advocates for a gospel presentation without an explicit call for repentance of sin. They define repetance to simply be a changing of one's mind—to avoid missapplying it as a meritorious work for one's salvation.
1. Praying to receive Christ is one way to express one's decision to personally trust Jesus as their Savior. It doesn't inherently save someone, but the heart attitude it represents does constitute true conversion.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Leon Morris can say, "Faith, for John, is an activity which takes men right out of themselves and makes them one with Christ."* (863)


#### 2022-08-01 22:05 Pages 880-920
##### What I learned:
1. A key difference between Protestantism and Catholicism is their definition of justification. Protestants believe justification does not change us internally and not a declaration of any goodness in us. Christ's righteousness is imputed onto us and we are counted righteous before God through faith alone in Christ as our Savior. Catholics believed in infused righteousness where God puts righteousness into us that changes us internally for our moral character.
1. The Catechism of the Catholic Church admits "so-called fiducial faith is not enough" and that a "theological or dogmatic" faith (teachings of the Catholic Church) is needed as well.
1. Faith does not earn us justification—it is the instrument through which we receive it.
2. James 2:24 uses the word righteous to mean "demonstrate or show to be righteous" rather than "declare to be righteous." We demonstrate that we have been declared our righteous by our actions.
3. The major flaw of the New Perspective on Paul is its redefinition of justification as God's declaration that we a part of the family of God. Grudem's main point is that nowhere in the Greek or in Paul's usage of the word indicate he meant justify to mean "to declare someone to part of a community."
4. Angels are spiritually alive beings who do not share the special privileges of family members in God's household.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Even when speaking of the Jewish people throughout the time of the Old Testament, the New Testament writers do not teach that all Jewish people were saved by election because they belonged to the covenant people of Israel but rather that those who did not have personal faith were not saved:* (907) see Romans 2:28-29, Romans 9:6, and 1 Cor 10:5.
- *Paul explains that this status of adoption as God's children was not fully realized in the old covenant.* (914)


#### 2022-08-02 22:17 Pages 920-960
##### What I learned:
1. Paul recognizes that we have been both set free from sin and that sin still remains in our lives. Our sanctification will never be completed in this life. Note that the usage of "sanctified" in Hebrews likens more what Paul means by justification.
1. Matthew 5:48 does not call for perfectionism. It simply shows that God's absolute moral purity is the standard we aim for and in which we will be held accountable for. In other words, God's perfection is the standard—not church tradition, denominational qualifications, or even standards held by loved ones and those we look up to.
1. Grudem lists 11 motives to obedience in the Christian life on pages 936 and 937.
2. C. Peter Wagner was the first person to coin the term, "third wave" charismatic Christianity in the 1980's.
3. Baptism in the Holy Spirit occured at conversion.
4. 1 Corinthians 12:13 stands at the crux of the biblical basis for being baptized *by* the Holy Spirit. "Baptized in the Holy Spirit" is a more accurate translation and would thus topple more Pentecostal interpretations of the verse.
5. Numbers 11:29 shows Moses longed for the day when the Holy Spirit would be poured out on all of God's people.
6. The case of the baptism of the Holy Spirit over the Samaritans in Acts 8 was to show Samaritans were included God's redemptive plan and were not second-class citizens to the church. They were full members and this thus fulfilled Jesus words in Acts 1:8 when he said his disciples would be witnesses to Samaria. 

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The day of Pentecost was the point of transition between the old covenant and ministry of the Holy Spirit and the new covenant work and ministry of the Holy Spirit.* (950)
- *the Holy Spirit will graciously bring a measure of the additional fullness and empowering that sincere Christians are seeking, even though their theological undersatnding and vocabulary may be imperfect in the asking.* (959)

#### 2022-08-16 21:37 Pages 960-1000
##### What I learned:
1. Grudem dislikes the term *baptism in the Holy Spirit* since it implies two groups of Christians. Nevertheless, the Bible does imply Christians should repeatedly be filled with the Holy Spirit (Eph 5:18).
1. There were many cases where being filled with the Holy Spirit did not result  in speaking in tongues such as when Jesus returned from 40 days fasting in the desert or Elizabeth while blessing Mary or Zechariah when prophesying.
1. Hebrews 6:9 gives context that salvation was something that was not part of the things in verses 4-6. It translates as "also belong to salvation" which implies they didn't have it to begin with.
2. 2 Peter 1:10 implies our assurance of salvation can be grow over time as we imitate the qualities layed out in verses 5-7.

##### Interesting Quote:
- from Wimber *The Pentecostal's experience of God is better than their explanation of it"* (963)
- *In his great wisdom, God decided that he would not apply to us the benefits of Christ's redemptive work all at once.* (989)


#### 2022-08-16 22:00 Pages 1000-1040
##### What I learned:
1. Purgatory was justified in Catholicism because of their inclusion of 2 Macabees (specifically 12:42-45) in the biblical canon.
1. Soul sleep is the doctrine that teaches believers enter a state of unconscious existence when they die. They become conscious when Christ returns and raises them to eternal life.
1. Hebrews 12:1 and 12:22-24 imply that those who have died have *some* awareness of what is going on in the earth.
2. People will recognize and know one another in heaven.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In the Pauline Epistles, the word spiritual (Gk. pneumatikos) seldom means "nonphysical" but rather "consistent with the character and activity of the Holy Spirit"* (1022)
- *Paul expected a considerable measure of continuity between our present earthly bodies and our future resurrection bodies.* (1024)
- *The factor that determines whether someone is a Christian is whether Christ is in him* (1036)

#### 2022-08-16 22:07 Pages 1040-1080
##### What I learned:
1. The church includes believers from both the Old and New Testament. Dispensationalists believe otherwise.
1. The two metaphors analogizing a "body" and Christ from 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4 should not be confused with one another.
1. Grudem criticizes the Seeker-Sensitive movement for their shadowing God's holiness with a "broader emphasis on God's immanent compassionate love."
2. John Wesley claimed he lived and died a member of the Anglican church.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *We should not try to exclude people from the fellowship of the church until they by public sin bring discipline upon themselves. On the other hand, of course, the church should not tolerate in its membership "public unbelievers" who by profession or life clearly proclaim themselves to be outside the true church.* (1051)
- from Geroge Ladd *The church is the community of the Kingdom but never the Kingdom itself.. The Kingdom is the rule of God; the church is a society of men.* (1058)
- *many liberal Protestant churches are in fact false churches today.🔥* (1063)


#### 2022-08-16 22:14 Pages 1080-1120
##### What I learned:
1. Catholics treat Tradition as authoritative as Scripture.
1. The books in the Apocrypha were not officially considered Scripture by the Roman Catholic church until 1546. *disputed*
1. Catholics believe baptism itself forgives all sins.
2. Romans 14:1-23 allows for a wide degree of tolerance.
3. There are no apostles who can speak and write the very "words of God", yet there are still effective missionaries and church planters who are called "apostles."

##### Interesting Quote:
- *In preaching the gospel and in exercising church discipline the church now exercises the authority of the keys of the kingdom.* (1099)


#### 2022-08-16 22:24 Pages 1120-1160
##### What I learned:
1. Ephesians 4:11 can be better translated as "shepherd-teachers" to include them both as one position.
1. Grudem interprets 1 Timothy 2:14 in light of how God created gender differences resulting in women being more inclined toward a relational and nurturing emphasis. This explains that Eve was less to inclined to oppose the serpent and accept his lies.
1. Women can teach in informal settings but not like elders teaching publicly in formal settings.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *The woman author does not have teaching authority over an assembled congregation or a gruop of men.* (1155)


#### 2022-08-16 22:33 Pages 1160-1200
##### What I learned:
1. Deborah and Huldah prophesied privately.
1. Women can be called to ministry, just not to be a pastor/elder in a church.
1. The Greek word for baptism means "to plunge, dip, immerse" something in water. Biblical examples who immersion in bodies of water was how they exercised baptism.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Moreover, there is not one example in the entire Bible of a woman doing the kind of congregatinal Bible teaching that is expected of pastors/elders in the New Testament church.* (1167)
- *The seeds for the destruction of slavery were sown in the New Testament (see Philem. 16; Eph. 6:9; Col. 4:1; 1 Tim. 6:1-2), but no seeds for the destruction of marriage, or the destruction of male-female differences as created, are sown in the Bible.* (1169)


#### 2022-08-16 22:40 Pages 1200-1240
##### What I learned:
1. The paedobaptist views baptism in parallel with circumcision in the Old Testament. Another big proponent of this view is the existence of household baptism in the early church which Grudem claims all members in the family became believers prior to their baptism.
1. In principle, there is no need to be ordained clergy to baptize someone.
1. God takes delight in creation.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *Catholics hold that the sacraments work even apart frmo the faith of the people participating in the sacrament.* (1202)


#### 2022-08-20 12:00 Pages 1240-1280
##### What I learned:
1. In 1 Corinthians 1:7, Paul mentions the possession of spiritual gifts in context of waiting for Christ's return. 
1. A worship leader should lead people to worship, not simply worship God by himself or with the band while everybody else watches. (1249)
1. Grudem no longer considers marriage and cliebacy as spiritual gifts since the Greek word used for gifts (*charisma*) is being used in a general context in 1 Corinthians 7:7. Paul used it in other passages as a general word for blessings or favor (Romans 5:15, 6:23; 2 Corinthians 1:11).
2. Spiritual gifts can be boiled down to two gifts as Peter does so in 1 Peter 4:11: whoever speaks and whoever serves.
3. Gifts can weaken when unused or neglected (Romans 12:7; 1 Tim. 4:14).
4. The spiritual gifts Paul urges us to pursue are those that most build up the church. The "greater gifts" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:31 are connected to the "greater" gift of prophecy which builds up the church in 1 Corinthians 14:12.

##### Interesting Quote:
- *This means that worship is doing the will of God.* (1243)
- *Just as the Holy Spirit himself is in this age a "down payment" (2 Cor. 1:22 NASB mg.; cf. 2 Cor. 5:5; Eph 1:14) of the fuller work of the Holy Spirit within us in the age to come, so the gifts of the Holy Spirit gives us are partial foretastes of the fuller working of the Holy Spirit that will be ours in the age to come.* (1258)
- on defending continuationism based on Chantry's argument for Paul's usage of teleios for perfect, *Yet here again we must note that a word does ont have to be used to refer to the same thing every time it is used in Scripture* (1278)

##### What I learned:
1. Cessationists who believe in illumuniation from the Holy Spirit should come to realize the gift of prophecy in the New Testament is not vastly different in practice.
1. Not all miracles accompanied the giving of Scripture. Elijah and Elisha don't have any writings in the Bible—nor does Stephen and Phillip.
1. B.B. Warfield, author of *Counterfeit Miracles*, supported cessationism to refute claims of miracles from Roman Catholicism and other heretical sects. He wrote this before the Azusa Street Revival—the outset of the Pentecostal and charismatic movement.
2. The Greek word for prophet in the New Testament times had a broad range of definitions. Verse like Titus 1:12 and Luke 22:64 show usage of the word outside of its narrower meaning in the Old Testament. Various extra biblical manuscripts also prove this.

- quoting Donald Gee (Assemblies of God) *Many of our errors where spiritual gifts arer concerned arise when we want the extraordinary and exceptional to be made the frequent and habitual.* (1283)
- *The apostles are the New Testament counterpart of the Old Testament prophets (see 1 Cor. 2:13; 2 Cor. 13:3; Gal. 1:8-9, 11-12; 1 Thess. 2:13; 4:8, 15; 2 Peter 3:2).* (1294)
- *the problem of successsors to the apostles is solved not by encouraging Christians to listen to the prophets (even though there were prophets around) but by pointing to the Scriptures.* (1299)

##### What I learned:
1. The "prophets" in Ephesians 2:20 and 3:5 refer to a small group of individuals who weren't apostles but were closley connected to them and played a foundational role in the beginning of the church.
2. Timothy was told to **teach** Paul's instructions to the church and the Thessalonians were told to affirm the tradition they were **taught** by Paul. Teachers, not prophets, were the leaders of the early church. 
3. Matthew quotes Isaiah 53:4-5 with reference to physical healings performed by Jesus.
4. 2 Chronicles 16:12-13 illustrate how it was wrong for King Asa to rely on doctors or medicine instead of relying on the Lord.
5. According Zephaniah 3:9, we will all "pure speech" and call upon the name of the Lord in the with one accord. We will all speak the same language in heaven (in addition to our current ones on Earth).
6. Grudem explains 1 Corinthians 14:20-25 really well. Paul's quotation of Isaiah 28 gives context to what he means by a "sign". ADFDALSJF;LDSJFLDAKFJL;DSF

- *The healing miracles of Jesus certainly demonstrate that at times God is willing to grant a partial foretaste of the perfect health that will be ours for eternity.* (1315)
