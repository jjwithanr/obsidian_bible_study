# Wisdom of Solomon 2

## Overview:



#### v.1
>or they reasoned unsoundly, saying to themselves,  
“Short and sorrowful is our life,  
and there is no remedy when a life comes to its end,  
and no one has been known to return from Hades.  

#### v.2
>For we were born by mere chance,  
and hereafter we shall be as though we had never been,  
for the breath in our nostrils is smoke,  
and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts;  

#### v.3
>when it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes,  
and the spirit will dissolve like empty air.  

#### v.4
>Our name will be forgotten in time,  
and no one will remember our works;  
our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud  
and be scattered like mist  
that is chased by the rays of the sun  
and overcome by its heat.  

#### v.5
>For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow,  
and there is no return from our death,  
because it is sealed up and no one turns back.

#### v.6
>“Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist  
and make use of the creation to the full as in youth.  

#### v.7
>Let us take our fill of costly wine and perfumes,  
and let no flower of spring pass us by.  

#### v.8
>Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither.  

#### v.9
>Let no meadow be free from our revelry;  
everywhere let us leave signs of enjoyment,  
because this is our portion, and this our lot.  

#### v.10
>Let us oppress the righteous poor man;  
let us not spare the widow  
or regard the gray hairs of the aged.  

#### v.11
>But let our might be our law of right,  
for what is weak proves itself to be useless.

#### v.12
>“Let us lie in wait for the righteous man,  
because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions;  
he reproaches us for sins against the law  
and accuses us of sins against our training.  

#### v.13
>He professes to have knowledge of God  
and calls himself a child of the Lord.  

#### v.14
>He became to us a reproof of our thoughts;  
the very sight of him is a burden to us,  

#### v.15
>because his manner of life is unlike that of others,  
and his ways are strange.  

#### v.16
>We are considered by him as something base,  
and he avoids our ways as unclean;  
he calls the last end of the righteous happy  
and boasts that God is his father.  

#### v.17
>Let us see if his words are true,  
and let us test what will happen at the end of his life,  

#### v.18
>for if the righteous man is God’s child, he will help him  
and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.  

#### v.19
>Let us test him with insult and torture,  
so that we may find out how reasonable he is  
and make trial of his forbearance.  

#### v.20
>Let us condemn him to a shameful death,  
for, according to what he says, he will be protected.”

#### v.21
>Thus they reasoned, but they were led astray,  
for their wickedness blinded them,  

#### v.22
>and they did not know the secret purposes of God,  
nor hoped for the wages of holiness,  
nor discerned the prize for blameless souls,  

#### v.23
>for God created us for incorruption  
and made us in the image of his own eternity,

#### v.24
>but through an adversary’s envy death entered the world,  
and those who belong to his company experience it.
