    Has anyone trusted in the Lord and been disappointed?  
Or has anyone persevered in the fear of the Lord and been forsaken?  
    Or has anyone called upon him and been neglected?  

About 1652, \[John Bunyan\] relates, during a time of deep depression, he found comfort in a text which came to his min: 'Look at the generation of old, and see: did ever any trust in the Lord and was confounded?' He could not remember where it came from, could not find it in his Bible, and received no help from others whom he asked for guidance in his quest. Then, after the lapse of year, he writes:
	casting my eye upon the Apocrypha books, I found it in Ecclesiasticus, chap. 2:10. This at first did somewhat daunt me, because it was not in those texts that we call holy and canonical; yet as this sentence was the sum and substance of many of the promises, it was my duty to take the comfort of it. And I bless God for that word, for it was of good to me. That word doth still oft-times shine before my face.

>For the Lord is compassionate and merciful;  
    he forgives sins and saves in time of distress.

    and to the sinner who walks a double path!  

#### v.13

    Therefore they will have no shelter.  

#### v.14
>Woe to you who have lost patience!  
    What will you do when the Lord’s reckoning comes?

 
#### v.15

    and those who love him will keep his ways.  

#### v.16
>Those who fear the Lord will seek his favor,  
    and those who love him will be filled with his law.

    and will humble themselves before him.  

#### v.18
>Let us fall into the hands of the Lord  
    but not into the hands of mortals,  
for equal to his majesty is his mercy.
