Apocalyptic is defined by its characteristics. It has some traceable roots outside the Bible (see the sidebar on Akkadian apocalypses in Dan 11) but finds its earliest true members in Old Testament books such as Daniel and Zechariah. In the Bible it is intricately intertwined with prophetic literature. There are over a dozen Jewish apocalyptic works during the intertestamental period, the most prominent being 4 Ezra and the books of Enoch. The book of Revelation is the New Testament\u2019s contribution to the genre. Other Christian apocalypses began to appear on the heels of the New Testament, including works like the Shepherd of Hermas, the Apocalypse of Peter and the Ascension of Isaiah. The genre was a favorite of the Gnostics, whose literature contains numerous examples. Apocalypses feature a narrative framework and often portray an angelic interpreter or guide alongside the prophet. The angel may take the prophet on a tour of heavenly realms to convey certain realities and activities. Alternatively, he may unveil a future time of trouble and deliverance. This literature operates by means of a broad spectrum of symbols using significant numbers and mythological images. It draws heavily on both biblical and extrabiblical literature. It tends to schematize. When reading apocalyptic, there are a couple of important guidelines to keep in mind. First, each detail does not necessarily carry symbolic significance. Even the details that do carry symbolic significance may not be transparent to us and speculating accomplishes little. Second, it is important to remember that the apocalyptic vision is not the message itself but rather is the vehicle or occasion for the message. So, for instance, the message of the first vision of Zechariah (1:7-17) is not that there are going to be four horses of different colors in a myrtle grove. The message is laid out very clearly in verses 14-17. Apocalyptic is simply a medium.</p>"},{"location":"Terms/#johnwalton","title":"johnwalton","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/2John/","title":"2 John","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/2John/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":"<p>Theme: Truth Truth 5 times; Commandment 4 times; Love 4 times; Doctrine 3 times Key Scripture: 1:9 Time of Writing: Late 1st Century A.D.</p> <p>Verses 1-6: Walking in True Doctrine Verses 7-13: Falling from True Doctrine</p> <p>Purpose: 1.

Two types of heresy appeared in the second century, arising out of the roots already appearing in the Johannine writings in the first century. The docetic heresy, on the one hand, argued that Jesus was not a real human being (not truly \"in the flesh\"), but only appeared to be human. He was truly Christ; the Christ was a spirit that appeared to materialize. Being a spirit, of course, he did not die on the cross, but in one way or another only appeared to suffer and die. (The term docetic comes from the Greek word meaning \"to seem or appear.\") The Cerinthian heresy, on the other hand, argued that Jesus was really a human being, but that at his baptism the Christ spirit came upon him, forsaking him at the crucifixion. Therefore the Christ did not die, although Jesus did. Although we do not know exactly what the heretics John is fighting believed (and some of them may have believed an early form of both of these heresies), the phrase in 2 John guards against both of them. And the believer acknowledges that this whole entity, \"Jesus Christ,\" has come from God and is really human. The form of the phraseology in 1 John 4:2-3 stresses Jesus' having come from God and becoming truly incarnate. The form here in 2 John 7 stresses that Jesus remains incarnate and did not in some way \"split apart\" at death or the ascension.

This is something that is the common property of all Christians, but something we can and should become more submitted and responsive to. \u201cAs oil was used among the Asiatics for the inauguration of persons in important offices, and this oil was acknowledged to be an emblem of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, without which the duties of those offices could not be discharged; so it is put here for the Spirit himself, who presided in the Church, and from which all gifts and graces flowed.\u201d (Clarke)</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/1%20John/1John2/#enduringword_3","title":"enduringword","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/1%20John/1John2/#v24","title":"v.24","text":"<p>See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you.

Since 1 Timothy 2:13 begins with the connective particle \"for...,\" it is clear that the following sentences are a continuation of what precedes. Thus this text gives Paul's biblical reflections that provide a rationale for his prohibition against women's teaching and usurping authority in the church (1 Tim 2:11-12), discussed in the previous chapter. The conclusion of that discussion was that Paul was addressing problems of heresy in the church at Ephesus and that the women in this congregation were strongly captivated by these false doctrines or were vocal proponents. Their teaching led to the questioning and rejection of culturally accepted norms and roles for men and women, causing difficulties for this young congregation within its social context. Paul is concerned that their witness to the truth of the gospel is thereby undermined. He is concerned with \"propriety\" (1 Tim 2:9,15), that is, socially accepable behavior; with the possbiliity of being \"disgraced\" in the sight of outsiders 1 Tim 3:7; and with giving \"the enemy no opportunity for slander\"1 Tim 5:14; 6:1. Paul's restrictive admonitions regarding women must be understood within this particular historical situation. They are therefore not to be understood as divine imperatives, applicable universally to all women in all cultural contexts and historical circumstances. Rather, they are authoritative apostolic counsel, given for the correction of abuses in a particular situation that threatened the truth of the gospel and the viabliity of a young church in an antagonistic environment. The transcendent principle standing behind Paul's particular instruction is the imperative of the gospel (applicable in all cultural contexts), namely, God's intention that \"all be saved\" (1 Tim 2:4; see also 1 Cor 10:33).</p> <p>But why does Paul ground all this in Scripture? Why argue for priority for the male on the basis of Genesis 2? Why does he reason for the woman's participation in the Fall (Gen 3) to a restricted role for her in the church? And finally what is the point about women being saved through childbearing?</p> <p>Answers to those questions begin to emerge when we recognize an essential truth of Paul's life: He was a rabbi who had been transformed into a follow of Christ. As a trained rabbi, he became a disciple of Jesus and an apostle to the Gentiles. His training as a rabbi - gained as a student of Gamaliel, one of the great rabbinic teachers in first-century Palestine (Acts 22:3) - was placed at the service of the interpretation and articulation of the gospel. Thus Paul's writings are thoroughly pervaded by scriptural citations or allusions. When we read 1 Timothy 2:13-14, we realize two things immediately. First, Paul does not quote the biblical passages directly. He gives us rather a particular and partial understanding of the meaning of those passages. Second, the situtation which he is addressing is a limited, local situation that calls for a limited, partial use of the biblical material. The reason he instructs women to be silent, not to teach and not to usurp authority over men (1 Tim 2:12) is because Adam was formed before Eve (1 Tim 2:13). The Genesis 2 creation narrative is of course referred to here. Within the synagogue, which provided a model for early church life and structure, male dominance was traditionally certified by a reading of the chronological sequence of Genesis 2 in terms of male priority.  A further argument for women's restricted place, given in 1 Timothy 2:14, is that Eve was deceived and became a sinner, while Adam was not deceived. Here as in the appeal to Genesis 2 above, Paul refers to a truth expressed in Genesis, this time in the story of the Fall in Genesis 3. In Genesis 3:13, Eve says that \"the serpent deceived me, and I ate.\" From this rabbinic tradition reasoned that women were by nature more vulnerable to deception than men. That view of womanhood was widespread in Judaism. Philo, the important Alexandrian Jewish scholar who was a contemporary of Paul, expressed the view tht since woman \"is more accustomed to be deceived than man and \"gives way and is taken in by plausible falsehoods which resemble the truth,\" the proper relation of a wife to a husband is epitomized in the verb \"to serve as a slave.\" His interpretive method and its application in the particular situation at Ephesus does not mean that he shared with his rabbinic tradition the view that women were inherently more deceivable. This is confirmed by the fact that Paul uses Eve's deception in 2 Corinthians 11:3-4 as an illustration of the possibility that all believers in Corinth, both men and women, may be deceived and led away from faith in Christ. Thus we see that Paul uses the Eve tradition variously, depending on the problem being addressed.</p> <p>A final difficulty of this text is the statement that \"women will be saved through childbearing\" (1 Tim 2:15). What is the meaning of this statement, and how does it function in the context of the whole passage?</p> <p>First, if there is one truth which Paul spent his entire ministry driving home to his listeners and readers, it is this: that salvation is not gained by the performance of functions and duties or the exercise of specific roles, but by faith in Jesus Christ. It is therefore impossible to conclude that Paul is speaking about personal salvation. That is, women are not saved by any other means than men. Second, 1 Timothy 2:15 is the conclusion to the entire paragraph. In 1 Timothy 2:9-14 the specific instructions to women are restrictive and negative. Verse 15 begins with the word \"but\" (or, better, \"yet\"), and what is said is apparently intended a positive affirmation. The various restrictions imposed on women are now qualified. They are not absolute norms, essential conditions determined by gender. Rather, they are necessary adjustments in light of the historical situation in which the missionary effectiveness of the young churches was at stake. In Timothy's situation, heretical teaching undermined the validity of marriage. We are not told why. But on basis on 1 Corinthians 7, where marriage seems to be rejected by the super spiritualists who despise physical, bodily reality, we can conclude that the heretical teaching viewed marriage, and its specific expression in the bearing of children, as negative, or as unworthy of those who were truly spiritual and members of a new community of \"saved\" persons. Over against that heretical teaching, Paul may be affirming that the bearing of children, which is a woman's natural procreative, life-giving function, does in fact not keep her from full participation in the community of the saved. Thus women are and will be saved, even as they perform those domestic and maternal roles expected of women in the social-historical context, but rejected by the heretical teachers. It is possible that the heretical teachers and the women who had been deceived by them saw a rejection of normal domestic and maternal roles as evidence that they were only truly saved and spiritual. Such a situation makes Paul's strong and difficult restrictive injunctions to the women in Ephesus absolutely necessary, for the heretical teaching and its consequences represented a comprehensive misunderstanding and denial of the gospel. </p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/1%20Timothy/1Timothy2/#hardsayingsofthebible","title":"hardsayingsofthebible","text":"<p>The apostle adds that the wife's role of submission to her husband is inherent in creation. Adam was created first, and then Eve (the story of Ge 2:21-23, where God made Eve from a rib taken from Adam). Many commentators have noted regarding this story that Eve was not made out of Adam's head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with him and near his heart to be loved by him. This expresses perfectly the ideal of a happy married life. The husband who has this concept will usually find his wife eager to please him.  Paul makes one further point. It was the woman who was deceived by Satan and who disobeyed God (cf. Ge 3:1-6).

More important than the historical examples are the instructions of Proverbs, which were understood as divine teaching. How could harmony be preserved when there were two contenders? \"Casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart\" (Prov 18:18). Could the dice really give God's answer? \"The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord\" (Prov 16:33).

But now in the wake of the coming of Jesus the Spirit is back, not resting only on a few prophets, but on the whole people of God. Many of them received the gift of prophecy. From this point on Acts records prophetic words that explain decisions (for example, \"the Spirit told me,\" Acts 11:12), indicate people chosen for special roles (Acts 13:2) and apparently lead to consensus (Acts 15:28). In the church empowered by the Spirit, God speaks through that Spirit. It is therefore no wonder that in such a context the lot and similar indirect means of discerning the divine will (such as seeking omens from God like Gideon's fleece) were relegated to history. We who live in a church still filled with that Spirit can continue to be thankful that due to our direct connection with God we no longer have to copy the means that were necessary for the first ten days of the church after Jesus left. </p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts1/#hardsayingsofthebible_1","title":"hardsayingsofthebible","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts10/","title":"Acts 10","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts10/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts10/#v2","title":"v.2","text":"<p>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.</p> <p>Lord, make me like Cornelius in my future family.

Salvation is a special interest of the author of Luke-Acts. It can mean deliverance from everything from sickness to sin, from political oppression to divine judgement. The lame man in Acts 3-4 had been saved by being healed, while Zechariah speaks of salvation in terms of deliverance from the political enemies of Israel (Lk 1:71). Acts 27:31 refers to rescue from a storm at sea as salvation. But a further issue is one of escaping divine judgement (Acts 2:21, 40). This escape not only is a rescue, but also has a positive side, namely, \"that times of refreshment may come from the Lord\" (Acts 3:19). This last meaning dominates the speeches in Acts. Thus while the author certainly knows many meanings for salvation (for example, that Jesus is the one through whom physical healing comes), the stress in this passage is on what he believes is the most significant meaning, salvation in its fullest sense: deliverance from divine judgement and the release of the blessings of God. This type of salvation, he states, comes only through Jesus Christ.</p> <p>It is significant that Peter makes this statement in front of Jewish leaders. Their Judaism could not save them. They needed the one \"name,\" the name of Jesus. This theme of the exclusiveness of salvation through Christ is repeated a number of times in Acts, but perhaps Paul puts it most starkly against Athenian Greek religion and philosophy when he states, \"In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man [Jesus] he has appointed\" (Acts 17:30-21). In other words, the teaching throughout Acts (and the rest of the New Testament, for that matter) is that there is only one way to escape God's judgement and receive his favor, and that is through Jesus. This exclusivity is a consistent claim of the early church.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts4/#hardsayingsofthebible","title":"hardsayingsofthebible","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts4/#v13","title":"v.13","text":"<p>When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts4/#v19-20","title":"v.19-20","text":"<p>But Peter and John replied, \"Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God. <sup>20</sup>For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.\"</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Acts/Acts4/#v24","title":"v.24","text":"<p>When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. \"Sovereign Lord,\" they said, \"you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.</p> <p>The church does not complain to God about what happened to Peter and John.

The context suggests that the errorists engaged in such \"worship\" (cf. v.18) in the hope that they would thereby acquire superior merit before God. \"Humility\" (GK 5425) must in this context refer to a mock humility (cf. v.18). The idea is that asceticism, while parading under the guise of humility, actually panders to human pride. \"Harsh treatment of the body\" is a reference to ascetic torturings of the body. \"Lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence\" translates a very difficult Greek construction. It suggests that the ascetics end up putting far more emphasis on the indulgence of the flesh than they ought to, and they are proud of it (cf. Gal 5:19-21). To sum up, v.23 teaches that ascetic rules have the appearance of wisdom for many people in that they seem to be expressions of devotion to God, of humility, and of a commendable discipline of the body. Paul, however, declares that these regulations have nothing to do with real wisdom, and the worship and humility they seem to express are both spurious.

We wish one another blessings; He gives the blessings. We try to train, to educate, to incline, and dispose, by the presentation of motives and the urging of reasons; He can plant in a heart by His own divine husbandry the seed that shall blossom into immortal life. And so the Christian Church is a great, continuous, supernatural community in the midst of the material world; and every believing soul, because it possesses something of the life of Jesus Christ, has been the seat of a miracle as real and true as when He said \u2018Lazarus, come forth!\u2019</p> <p>It is not any one aspect of it that is to be strengthened, but it is the whole intellect, affections, desires, tastes, powers of attention, conscience, imagination, memory, will. The whole inner man in all its corners is to be filled, and to come under the influence of this power, \u2018until there be no part dark, as when the bright shining of a candle giveth thee light</p> <p>That indwelling Spirit will be a power for suffering. The parallel passage to this in the twin epistle to the Colossians is-\u2019strengthened with all might unto all patience and long-suffering with gentleness.\u2019 Ah, brethren! unless this Divine Spirit were a power for patience and endurance it were no power suited to us poor men. So dark at times is every life; so full at times of discouragements, of dreariness, of sadness, of loneliness, of bitter memories, and of fading hopes does the human heart become, that if we are to be strong we must have a strength that will manifest itself most chiefly in this, that it teaches us how to bear, how to weep, how to submit.  </p> <p>==And it will be a power for conflict. We have all of us, in the discharge of duty and in the meeting of temptation, to face such tremendous antagonisms that unless we have grace given to us which will enable us to resist, we shall be overcome and swept away. God\u2019s power given by the Divine Spirit does not absolve us from the fight, but it fits us for the fight. It is not given in order that, holiness may be won without a struggle, as some people seem to think, but it is given to us in order that in the struggle for holiness we may never lose \u2018one jot of heart or hope,\u2019 but may be \u2018able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.\u2019==</p> <p>And so we appropriate and enclose, as it were, within our own little fence, a tiny portion of the great prairie that rolls boundlessly to the horizon. But to-morrow we may enclose more, if we will, and more and more; and so ever onwards, for all that is God\u2019s is ours, and He has given us His whole self to use and to possess through our faith in His Son. A thimble can only take up a thimbleful of the ocean, but what if the thimble be endowed with a power of expansion which has no term known to men? May it not, then, be that some time or other it shall be able to hold so much of the infinite depth as now seems a dream too audacious to be realised?  </p> <p>So it is with us and God. He lets us come into the vaults, as it were, where in piles and masses the ingots of uncoined and uncounted gold are stored and stacked; and He says, \u2018Take as much as you like to carry.\u2019 There is no limit except the riches of His glory.  </p> <p>And now, dear friends, remember that this great gift, offered to each of us, is offered on conditions.

And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,</p> <p>It is not to be weakened down into any notion of participation in His likeness, sympathy with His character, submission to His influence, following His example, listening to His instruction, or the like. A dead Plato may so influence his followers, but that is not how a living Christ influences His disciples. What is meant is no mere influence derived but separable from Him, however blessed and gracious that influence might be, but it is the presence of His own self, exercising influences which are inseparable from His presence, and only to be realised when He dwells in us.</p> <p>And so we are called \u2018mystics\u2019 when we preach Christ in the heart.

Any of you who can consult the original for yourselves will see that the Apostle here uses a compound word which conveys the idea of intensity and continuity. What he desires, then, is not merely that these Ephesian Christians may have occasional visits of the indwelling Lord, or that at some lofty moments of spiritual enthusiasm they may be conscious that He is with them, but that always, in an unbroken line of deep, calm receptiveness, they may possess, and know that they possess, an indwelling Saviour.  </p> <p>And this, I think, is one of the reasons why we may and must distinguish between the apparently very similar petition in the previous verse, about which we spoke in the last sermon, and the petition which is now occupying us; for, as I shall have to show you, it is only as \u2018strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man\u2019 that we are capable of the continuous abiding of that Lord within us.</p> <p>It is Christ in the heart that makes the heart fit for Christ to dwell in the heart.

So the heart that is lifted up and self-complacent has no dew of His blessing resting upon it, but has the curse of Gilboa adhering to its barrenness; but the low lands, the humble and the lowly hearts, are they in which the waters that go softly scoop their course and diffuse their blessings. Faith is self-distrust. Self-distrust brings the Christ.</p> <p>Mystical Christianity of the false sort has much to say about the indwelling of God in the soul, but it spoils all its teaching by insisting upon it that the condition on which God dwells in the soul is the soul\u2019s purifying itself to receive Him. But you cannot cleanse your hearts so as to bring Christ into them, you must let Him come and cleanse them by the process of His coming, and fit them thereby for His own indwelling. And, assuredly, He will so come, purging us from our evil and abiding in our hearts.</p> <p>Where Christ abides in a man\u2019s heart, love will be the very soil in which his life will be rooted and grow.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians3/#maclaren_1","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Ephesians/Ephesians3/#v18","title":"v.18","text":"<p>may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,</p> <p>There be two kinds of knowledge: the mere rattle of notions in a man\u2019s brain, like the seeds of a withered poppy-head; very many, very dry, very hard; that will make a noise when you shake them.

Live by the spirit and you will not need a hard outward law, nor will you be in bondage to the works of the flesh.\u2019 That feud in the Galatian churches was the earliest battle which Christianity had to fight between two eternal tendencies of thought--the conception of religion as consisting in outward obedience to a law, and consequently as made up of a series of painful efforts to keep it, and the conception of religion as being first the implanting of a new, divine life, and needing only to be nourished and cared for in order to drive forth evils from the heart, and so to show itself living. The difference goes very far and very deep, and these two views of what religion is have each their adherents to-day.

There are burdens which can be shared, and there are burdens which cannot. </p> <p>Let us take the case from which the whole context has arisen. Paul was exhorting the Galatians, as I explained, in reference to their duty to a fallen brother; and he speaks of him--according to our version--as \u2018overtaken in a fault.\u2019 Now, that is scarcely his idea, I think. The phrase, as it stands in our Bibles, suggests that Paul is trying to minimise the gravity of the man\u2019s offence; but just in proportion as he minimised its gravity would he weaken his exhortation to restore him. But what he is really doing is not to make as little as possible of the sin, but to make as much of it as is consistent with the truth.</p> <p>We have come across people who chiefly show their own purity by their harsh condemnation of others\u2019 sins. One has heard of women so very virtuous that they would rather hound a fallen sister to death than try to restore her; and there are saints so extremely saintly that they will not touch the leper to heal him, for fear of their own hands being ceremonially defiled. Paul says, \u2018Bear ye one another\u2019s burdens\u2019; and especially take a lift of each other\u2019s sin.</p> <p>There is the awful burden of personal existence. It is a solemn thing to be able to say \u2018I.\u2019 And that carries with it this, that after all sympathy, after all nestling closeness of affection, after the tenderest exhibition of identity of feeling, and of swift godlike readiness to help, each of us lives alone. </p> <p>Then again, there is the burden of responsibility which can be shared by none.</p> <p>And then, closely connected with responsibility there is another--the burden of the inevitable consequences of transgression, not only away yonder in the future, when all human bonds of companionship shall be broken, and each man shall \u2018give account of himself to God,\u2019 but here and now; as in the immediate context the Apostle tells us, \u2018Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u2019 The effects of our evil deeds come back to roost; and they never make a mistake as to where they should alight.</p> <p>I rejoice as much as any man in the largely increased sense of mutual responsibility and obligation of mutual aid, which is sweetening society by degrees amongst us to-day, but I believe that no Socialistic or other schemes for the regeneration of society which are not based on the Incarnation and Sacrifice of Jesus Christ will live and grow. There is but one power that will cast out natural selfishness, and that is love to Christ, apprehending His Cross as the great example to which our lives are to be conformed. I believe that the growing sense of brotherhood amongst us, even where it is not consciously connected with any faith in Christianity, is, to a very large extent, the result of the diffusion through society of the spirit of Christianity, even where its body is rejected.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Galatians/Galatians6/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":"<p>The design of this passage is, to prevent people from forming an improper estimate of themselves, and of the opinions of others.

But the New Translation of J.N. Darby is especially good in regard to this word: \"Faith is the substantiating of things hoped for\". That is much better. It implies the making of them real in experience. How do we 'substantiate' something? We are doing so every day. We cannot live in the world without doing so. Do you know the difference between substance and 'substantiating'? A substance is an object, something before me. 'Substantiating' means that I have a certain power or faculty that makes that substance to be real to me. Let us take a simple illustration. By means of our senses we can take things of the world of nature and transfer them into our consciousness so that we can appreciate them. Sight and hearing, for example, are two of my faculties which substantiate to me the world of light and sound. We have colours: red, yellow, green, blue, violet; and these colours are real things. But if I shut my eyes, then to me the colour is no longer real; it is simply nothing - to me.

As long as the faith continues, whether it be well-founded or not, it gives all the force of reality to what is believed. We feel and act just as if it were so, or as if we saw the object before our eyes. This, I think, is the clear meaning here. We do not see the things of eternity.

Although he is considered one of the greatest missionary champions of church history, he longed for a more intimate relationship with Christ. \"I prayed, agonized, fasted, strove, made resolutions, read the word more diligently, sought more time for retirement and meditation\u2014but all was without effect,\" he pined. \"I knew that if I would abide in Christ all would be well, but I could not.\" Taylor reached a turning point in his life when he received a letter from a colleague. This simple message unlocked the door: ===\"Friendship with God comes not from striving after faith but from resting in the faithful one.\" ===Those simple words were somehow precisely what Hudson Taylor needed to help him cross a threshold in his relationship with Christ.

Isaiah 40 is the turning point in that book, pivoting from the prediction of the exile (39:5\u20136) to God\u2019s promise to \u201ccomfort\u201d his people (40:1).

John is the God-sent \u201cmessenger\u201d (angelos) from Exodus 23:20, fulfilling the role of the angel in the exodus who went before the nation on the way through the wilderness.

There you will see him, just as he told you.'\"</p> <p>Sin is mighty, but one thing sin cannot do, and that is to make Christ cease to love us. Sin is mighty, but one other thing sin cannot do, and that is to prevent Christ from manifesting His love to us sinners, that we may learn to love and so may cease to sin. \ud83d\udd25Christ\u2019s love is not at the beck and call of our fluctuating affections. It has its source deeper than in the springs in our hearts, namely in the depths of His own nature. It is not the echo or the answer to ours, but ours is the echo to His; and that being so, our changes do not reach to it, any more than earth\u2019s seasons affect the sun. For ever and ever He loves. Whilst we forget Him, He remembers us.</p> <p>If one was to be singled out from the little company to receive by name the summons of the Lord to meet Him in Galilee, we might have expected it to have been that faithful friend who stood beneath the Cross, till his Lord\u2019s command sent him to his own home; or that weeping mother whom he then led away with him; or one of the two who had been turned from secret disciples into confessors by the might of their love, and had laid His body with reverent care in the grave in the garden. Strange reward for true love that they should be merged in the general message, and strange recompense for treason and cowardice that Peter\u2019s name should be thus distinguished! Is sin, then, a passport to His deeper love? Is the murmur true after all, \u2018Thou never gavest me a kid, but as soon as this thy son is come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf\u2019? Yes, and no. No, inasmuch as the unbroken fellowship hath in it calm and deep joys which the returning prodigal does not know, and all sin lays waste and impoverishes the soul. Yes, inasmuch as He, who knows all our needs, knows that the denier needs a special treatment to bring him back to peace, and that the further a poor heart has strayed from Him, the mightier must be the forthputting of manifested love, if it is to be strong enough to travel across all the dreary wastes, and draw back again, to its orbit among its sister planets, the wandering star. The depth of our need determines the strength of the restorative power put forth. They who had not gone away would come at the call addressed to them all, but he who had sundered himself from them and from the Lord would remain in his sad isolation, unless some special means were used to bring him back. The more we have sinned, the less can we believe in Christ\u2019s love; and so the more we have sinned, the more marvellous and convincing does He make the testimony and operations of His love to us. It is ever to the poor bewildered sheep, lying panting in the wilderness, that He comes. Among His creatures, the race which has sinned is that which receives the most stupendous proof of the seeking divine love. Among men, the publicans and the harlots, the denying Peters and the persecuting Pauls, are they to whom the most persuasive entreaties of His love are sent, and on whom the strongest powers of His grace are brought to bear. Our sin cannot check the flow of His love. More marvellous still, our sin occasions a mightier burst of the manifestation of His love, for eyes blinded by selfishness and carelessness, or by fear and despair, need to see a brightness beyond the noonday sun, ere they can behold the amazing truth of His love to them; and what they need, they get. \u2018Go, tell Peter.\u2019</p> <p>It is very instructive to observe how deeply the experiences of his fall, and of Christ\u2019s mercy then, had impressed themselves on Peter\u2019s memory, and how constantly they were present with him all through his after-life. His Epistles are full of allusions which show this. For instance, to go a step further back in his life, he remembered that the Lord had said to him, \u2018Thou art Peter,\u2019 \u2018a stone,\u2019 and that his pride in that name had helped to his rash confidence, and so to his sin. Therefore, when he is cured of these, he takes pleasure in sharing his honour with his brethren, and writes, \u2018Ye also, as living stones, are built up.\u2019 He remembered the contempt for others and the trust in himself with which he had said, \u2018Though all should forsake Thee, yet will not I\u2019; and, taught what must come of that, he writes, \u2018Be clothed with humility, for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\u2019 He remembered how hastily he had drawn his sword and struck at Malchus, and he writes, \u2018If when ye do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.\u2019 He remembered how he had been surprised into denial by the questions of a sharp-tongued servant-maid, and he writes, \u2018Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness.\u2019 He remembered how the pardoning love of his Lord had honoured him unworthy, with the charge, \u2018Feed My sheep,\u2019 and he writes, ranking himself as one of the class to whom he speaks-\u2019The elders I exhort, who am also an elder . . . feed the flock of God.\u2019 He remembered that last command, which sounded ever in his spirit, \u2018Follow thou Me,\u2019 and discerning now, through all the years that lay between, the presumptuous folly and blind inversion of his own work and his Master\u2019s which had lain in his earlier question, \u2018Why cannot I follow Thee now? I will lay down my life for Thy sake\u2019-he writes to all, \u2018Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps,\u2019</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Mark/Mark16/#maclaren-on-apostle-peter","title":"maclaren on Apostle Peter","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Mark/Mark16/#v8","title":"v.8","text":"<p>Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb.

Since Jesus is the divinely appointed agent for leading the battle against the forces of evil, those who wish to see the triumph of God's cause must follow him. If they do not, then whatever they may think themselves, they are effectively on the enemy's side. As for the added words about gathering and scattering, gathering is the work of God, while scattering is the work of Satan. God is the God of peace; Satan is the author of strife... The latter saying is related to the same subject, although it comes in the course of a narrative, as the punch line in what is sometimes called a \"pronouncement story.\" The story is told, that is to say, for the sake of the pronouncement to which it leads up. Here, then, we have such a punch line. John, one of the two \"sons of thunder\" (as Jesus called him and his brother James because of their stormy temperament), tells Jesus that he and his companions saw someone casting out demons in Jesus' name, \"and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us\" (Mk 9:38). In other words, he was not one of the regularly recognized disciples of Jesus. But he was showing clearly which side he was on in the spiritual warfare; moreover, he was acknowledging the authority of Jesus, because it was in his name that he was casting out demons. This was a far cry from the spirit that ascribed Jesus' demon-expelling power to the aid of Beelzebul. By his words and actions he was showing himself to be on Jesus' side.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Mark/Mark9/#hardsayingsofthebible","title":"hardsayingsofthebible","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Mark/Mark9/#v49","title":"v.49","text":"<p>Everyone will be salted with fire.</p> <p>Brethren, for a man by his own unaided effort, however powerful, continuous, and wisely directed it may be, to cleanse himself utterly from his iniquity, is as hopeless as it would be for him to sit down with a hammer and a chisel and try by mechanical means to get all the iron out of a piece of ironstone.

The coming of the Son of Man refers to the same event as the coming of the kingdom, even though the two expressions are conceptually complementary. Thus the coming of the Son of Man brings in the consummated kingdom. But the kingdom, as we have seen, comes in stages. In one sense Jesus was born a king (2:2); in another he has all authority as a result of his passion and resurrection (28:18); and in yet another his kingdom awaits the end.

This places the responsibility for the divine rejection of those who fail to become disciples on their own shoulders while guaranteeing that none of what is taking place stands outside God's control and plan.</p> <p>This sheds much light on the parables. It is naive to say Jesus spoke them so that everyone might more easily grasp the truth, and it is simplistic to say that the sole function of parables to outsiders was to condemn them. If Jesus simply wished to hide the truth from the outsiders, he need never have spoken to them. His concern on mission (9:35-38; 10:1-10; 28:16-20) excludes that idea. So he must preach without casting his pearls before pigs (7:6). He does so in parables\u2014i.e., in such a way as to harden and reject those who are hard of heart and to enlighten his disciples. His disciples, it must be remembered, are not just the Twelve but those who were following him (see comment on 5:1-12) and who, it is hoped, go on to do the will of Father (12:50) and do not end up blaspheming the Spirit (12:30-32).

Views of children were substantially different in the first-century world than in our contemporary Western context, so we are prone to import into this passage qualities of children as we perceive them. We might, for example, highlight the innocence of children, when in a first-century Greco-Roman context children were viewed as less reliable than adults, who had the full measure of logos or rational capacity. We might also emphasize that children are humble in attitude, as the language of Matthew 18:4 in some English versions suggests (e.g., \u201cwhoever becomes humble like this child\u201d [NRSV]). Yet children are not necessarily humble in the sense of holding an attitude of selflessness. Instead, as we have seen above, children are an example in the first-century world of those with little status. As the NIV reads, \u201cWhoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d We can teach this text well by helping people to understand that they should renounce status preoccupation in favor of taking care of those most vulnerable and marginalized in the community of faith.

God is angry with the wicked, Psalm 7:11. Jesus looked on the hypocritical Pharisees with anger, Mark 3:5. So it is said, \"Be ye angry, and sin not, Ephesians 4:26. This anger, or indignation against sin, is not what our Saviour speaks of here. What he condemns here is anger without a cause; that is, unjustly, rashly, hastily, where no offence has been given or intended. In that case it is evil; and it is a violation of the sixth commandment, because \"he that hateth his brother, is a murderer,\" 1 John 3:15. He has a feeling which would lead him to commit murder, if it were fully acted out. The word \"brother\" here refers not merely to one to whom we are nearly related, having the same parent or parents, as the word is commonly used, but includes also a neighbor, or perhaps anyone with whom we may be associated.

As noted earlier, this powerful and yet simple contrast in destinies recalls Deuteronomy 27\u201330, especially 30:15\u201320 and the \u201ctwo ways\u201d tradition specified there: if Israel obeys the stipulations of the Torah, they will experience the blessing of the covenant, which is life, but if they disregard the Torah, they will experience the curse of the covenant, which is wrath in the form of exile (cf. 30:4\u20135).</p> <p>But does the teaching in Romans 2:6\u201311 contradict Paul\u2019s gospel that justification before God at the final judgment depends solely on faith and not on works (so Rom. 1:16\u201317)? Not when one keeps in mind the overarching purpose of Romans 1:18\u20133:20, which is that Paul wants to show that acceptance before a righteous God is based on perfectly following his law, which, in fact, no one can do, not even Jews. Coming to grips with that reality, Paul hopes, will drive the sinner into the arms of God\u2019s grace and mercy in Jesus Christ (see Rom. 3:21\u20134:25).</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#cmarvinpate","title":"cmarvinpate","text":""},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v6","title":"v.6","text":"<p>God \"will give to each person according to what he has done.\"</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v7","title":"v.7","text":"<p>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v8","title":"v.8","text":"<p>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v9","title":"v.9","text":"<p>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v10","title":"v.10","text":"<p>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v11","title":"v.11","text":"<p>For God does not show favoritism.</p>"},{"location":"New%20Testament/Romans/Romans2/#v12","title":"v.12","text":"<p>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s point in 2:12 is that because God is impartial, both Gentiles and Jews will be judged based on the amount of revelation to which they have access: for Gentiles, natural law (though that overlaps with the Torah [see 2:14]); for Jews, the Torah.

Four factors about these sites would be problematic for the biblical authors. First, Jeroboam\u2019s act revealed that he does not trust the prophetic word from Ahijah that God would give him ten tribes and that, if he obeyed, his dynasty would be secure (1 Kgs 11:38). Second, Jeroboam\u2019s choice of these locations conflicted with Deuteronomy\u2019s emphasis that YHWH would choose one central place of worship (Deut 12:5, 11, 14, 18, 21, 26). Third, Jeroboam\u2019s altars were associated with non-orthodox religious practices like high places, non-Levitical priests, and an alternative religious festival. Fourth, and most shockingly, the construction of golden calves is the same sin that their ancestors committed in the wilderness. Amazingly, Jeroboam even uses the same language that Aaron did when he presented his golden calf to the people (Exod 32:4). The story of Jeroboam\u2019s persistent sin reminds us that God desires pure worship. Peripheral aspects of worship, such as buildings, locations, or types of music, can quickly take our focus off God and become idolatrous.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Kings/1Kings12/#storyofgod-davidlamb","title":"storyofgod #davidlamb","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Kings/1Kings12/#v33","title":"v.33","text":"<p>On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel.

Saul\u2019s sin is not that he offers the sacrifice prematurely (because he does wait until the time set by Samuel is up). His sin is that he disrespects Samuel\u2019s authority by offering the sacrifice himself. In 10:8 Samuel makes it clear that he himself is the one who will offer the sacrifice and give Saul his orders.

So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.\"</p> <p>On closer inspection, Saul\u2019s viewpoint is flawed in at least three important ways: (1)\u00a0His concern about his dwindling forces reveals a belief that human armies, not the Lord, will decide the battle (in this regard recall Judg. 7). (2)\u00a0His concern with offering a sacrifice reveals a faulty theology that elevates ritual above obedience (see 15:22\u201323) and tends to think that ritual can in some way guarantee divine favor. (3)\u00a0Saul oversteps his bounds. He is the king, but he is under the authority of the prophet-priest Samuel, who is the intercessor for the nation (cf. 7:7\u201311; 12:18\u201319, 23). In Deuteronomy 17\u201318, where the regulations of Israelite kingship are given (17:14\u201320; cf. 1\u00a0Sam. 10:25), the king\u2019s role is clearly distinguished from that of the priests (Deut. 18:1\u201313) and the prophets (18:14\u201322). As noted above, Samuel has made it clear that he will offer the sacrifices (cf. 10:8) and that he, in his prophetic capacity, will give the king instructions. Even the girls whom Saul met when he entered Samuel\u2019s town recognized Samuel\u2019s authority in this regard (9:13). Ironically, their statement that \u201cthe people will not begin eating until\u201d Samuel the man of God / seer (cf. 9:10\u201311) arrives to \u201cbless the sacrifice\u201d anticipates Saul\u2019s failure to obey Samuel. This lack of respect for the prophetic office subsequently becomes a major issue in Israel and a prominent theme in the Former Prophets.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Samuel/1Samuel13/#robertchisholm_2","title":"robertchisholm","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Samuel/1Samuel13/#v13","title":"v.13","text":"<p>\"You acted foolishly,\" Samuel said. \"You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Samuel/1Samuel13/#v14","title":"v.14","text":"<p>But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command.\"</p> <p>It was always God\u2019s intention for Israel to have a king (cf.\u00a0Deut 17:14-20). However, it was to be God\u2019s choice (cf.\u00a0Deut 17:15). Yet when the time came, Israel wanted a king \u201clike all the other nations\u201d (1 Sam 8:5). Their desire to be like the other nations tainted the entire process. God gave them the king of their choice, and it did NOT turn out well. In contrast, after Saul had disqualified his kingship, Samuel related that God would now pick a king \u201cafter his own heart\u201d (i.e., his choice).</p> <p>This understanding also seems confirmed by Akkadian parallels which use similar language to communicate the choosing of a king. For example, in the East India House Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II, we read, \u201cI, his eldest son, the chosen of his heart\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Another example is the Babylonian Chronicle which relates to Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s choice of king Zedekiah (not mentioned by name in the Chronicle). After deposing Jehoiachin in 598 BC, the Chronicle reads, \u201cHe appointed therein a king of his own heart.\u201d</p> <p>These Akkadian parallels show us is that it is preferred to take the phrase, \u201ca man after God\u2019s own heart\u201d as a reference to God\u2019s choice of kingship. In other words, David was God\u2019s choice for king. This means the phrase a man after God\u2019s own heart does not relate to moral quality of David in and of itself.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Samuel/1Samuel13/#goeman-article","title":"goeman article","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/1%20Samuel/1Samuel13/#v15","title":"v.15","text":"<p>Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him.

Is it just for God to punish children for the sins of their ancestors? The Old Testament teaches that individuals do sometimes suffer the consequences of their forebears\u2019 deeds. The Lord warns his enemies that their sin will have negative consequences for their families through three or four generations (Exod. 20:5; 34:7; Num. 14:18). Dathan\u2019s, Abiram\u2019s, and Achan\u2019s innocent children died along with their sinful parents (Num. 16:27, 32 [apparently Korah\u2019s sons were spared: Num. 26:11]; Josh. 7:24). The Lord also took the lives of four of David\u2019s sons because of his sin against Uriah (2\u00a0Sam. 12:5\u20136, 10; cf. 12:14\u201315; 13:28\u201329; 18:15; 1\u00a0Kings 2:25). Though Jeremiah anticipates a day when God\u2019s judgment will operate on a strictly individual basis, he assumes that God has judged the children for their ancestors\u2019 sins in the past (31:29\u201330; cf. Lam. 5:7). However, the Old Testament law says a son should not be executed for his father\u2019s sin (Deut. 24:16; cf. 2\u00a0Kings 14:6). Ezekiel 18 seems to suggest that God himself abides by this principle and judges a person on the basis of the person\u2019s own actions, not those of the parents. How can this apparent contradiction be harmonized? In each case in which children are punished for their parents\u2019 sin, direct rebellion against God is in view. (The Israelites made a solemn oath before God that they would live in peace with the Gibeonites [Josh. 9:18\u201320].) Because of the principle of corporate solidarity, the sovereign God of the universe has the freedom to judge a couple\u2019s descendants when divine authority has been directly challenged, but God does not allow humans\u2014being finite and prone to injustice and excessive vengeance\u2014that same freedom in civil cases. Ezekiel 18 deals with a somewhat different situation. Here the hypothetical children in the illustrations are actively pursuing evil or righteousness in their daily lives. These exiles can rest assured that their forebears\u2019 character will not negate their own behavior, for better or worse. For Ezekiel\u2019s generation, this is the important principle to recognize. They are not mere victims of God\u2019s judgment on their fathers and mothers. They too are sinners and need to take personal responsibility for their own actions. God in his grace has preserved them. He has given them opportunity to repent of their evil and to do what is right. Through the prophet Ezekiel, God assures the exiles that he will reward a proper response, regardless of their ancestors\u2019 shortcomings.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel21/#robertchisholm-teachthetext","title":"robertchisholm #teachthetext","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel21/#v7","title":"v.7","text":"<p>The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel21/#v8","title":"v.8","text":"<p>But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel21/#v9","title":"v.9","text":"<p>He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD.

But surely, given his moral failures and shortcomings, David is not claiming to be innocent in an absolute sense. David speaks here in general terms, using covenant terminology that derives from a context where only two extremes (loyalty and disloyalty) exist. As he reflects on his life, he asserts that loyalty to the Lord has characterized his attitudes and actions. Three observations support this interpretation: (1)\u00a0The heading (v.\u00a01) and style of the song indicate that David is generalizing about his experience. In verses 4\u201320 he treats his many narrow escapes as if they were one great event in which he experiences divine deliverance. In verses 33\u201346 he describes his numerous battles as if they were one decisive conflict. (2)\u00a0Later in the Former Prophets, reflection on David\u2019s career casts him in the role of a loyal, even paradigmatic, follower of the Lord (1\u00a0Kings 3:3, 6, 14; 9:4; 11:4, 6, 33\u201334, 38; 14:8; 15:3, 5, 11; 2\u00a0Kings 14:3; 16:2; 18:3; 22:2). (3)\u00a0In portraying attitudes toward the Lord, the psalms consistently speak of two groups, the righteous and the wicked. In this song these two groups are clearly differentiated (vv. 26\u201328). Though David at times failed to walk in accordance with God\u2019s covenant, he demonstrated in his attitudes and actions an allegiance to the Lord that was in contrast to the consistent anticovenant behavior of the wicked.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#robertchisholm-teachthetext","title":"robertchisholm #teachthetext","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#v22","title":"v.22","text":"<p>For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#v23","title":"v.23","text":"<p>All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#v24","title":"v.24","text":"<p>I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#v25","title":"v.25","text":"<p>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#v26","title":"v.26","text":"<p>\"To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/2%20Samuel/2Samuel22/#v27","title":"v.27","text":"<p>to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.</p> <p>The point is that God sometimes uses deception to thwart the purposes of those who are morally and ethically corrupt.

Their actions are the antithesis of just and upright behavior (8:8; 11:20; 19:1; 28:6).

But 2Mc 9:1-28 states that Antiochus had attempted to raid a temple in Persepolis (rather than Elymais), and that it was at Ecbatana that he heard the disturbing news of the Maccabean victories. Then, as he was uttering dire threats of reprisal against them, he was seized with severe abdominal pains that never left him; and thus he fell out of the chariot in which he was riding. Finally, as a result of his severe injuries from the fall and the attack of worms on his bowels, accompanied by a revolting stench, he finally died with vain petitions on his lips, imploring the God of Israel to spare his life.

The covenant God made with all living things following the great flood (Gen. 9:16), the Lord\u2019s covenant with Abraham (Gen. 17:1\u201322; see also Ps. 105:10//1 Chr. 16:17), the covenant God gave at Sinai (Exod. 31:16; Lev. 24:8) and the covenant of kingship with David\u2019s line (2 Sam. 23:5) are all said to be everlasting covenants. Yet these are all past covenants, not future ones. Further, it is clear that Ezekiel understands none of these covenants as \u201ceverlasting\u201d in the sense that they guarantee survival for Israel: indeed, quite to the contrary, Judah and Jerusalem are doomed. As in Jeremiah 31:31\u201334, the promised covenant is implicitly discontinuous with the former, broken one (see the discussion of Ezek. 11:19\u201321, above). Ezekiel, Jeremiah and, later, Second Isaiah, understood berit \u02bfolam in new ways. For these prophets of the exile, the focus of the berit \u02bfolam became the future, not the past.

This everlasting covenant will not be between the Lord and some exalted individual\u2014Abraham or Moses or David\u2014but between the Lord and the people (as v. 60 here makes clear; see also 37:25\u201326 where, though David is to be prince forever, God makes the \u201ceverlasting covenant\u201d with the people, and compare Jer. 32:40; 50:5; and Isa. 55:3\u20135).</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel16/#steventuell-understandingthebible_1","title":"steventuell #understandingthebible","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Ezekiel/Ezekiel16/#v61","title":"v.61","text":"<p>Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger.

Now he gives the purpose for this. Two important points are in danger of being obscured by the English translations. The first is the change from the Hebrew word for \"put\" to a term that the author elsewhere has reserved for God's \"rest\" or \"safety\" (GK 5663), a safety that he gives to people in the land (e.g., Ge 19:16; Dt 3:20; 12:10; 25:19), and the \"dedication\" of something in the presence of the Lord (Ex 16:33-34; Lev 16:23; Nu 17:4; Dt 26:4,10). Both senses appear to lie behind the word here. Man was \"put\" into the garden where he could \"rest\" and be \"safe,\" and he was \"put\" into the garden \"in God's presence\" where he could have fellowship with God (3:8). A second point is the specific purpose for which God put man in the garden. Most translations have \"to work it and take care of it.\" Although that translation is as early as LXX (2d cent. B.C.), there are serious objections to it. For one, the suffixed pronoun in the Hebrew text rendered \"it\" in English is feminine, whereas the noun \"garden\" is masculine. Only by changing the pronoun to a masculine singular, as the LXX has done, can it have the sense of the EVs, namely \"to work\" and \"to keep.\" Moreover, later in the same narrative (3:23) \"to work the ground\" is said to be a result of the Fall, and the narrative suggests that the author had intended such a punishment to be seen as an ironic reversal of the man's original purpose. If such was the case, then \"working\" and \"keeping\" the garden would not provide a contrast to \"working the ground.\" In light of these objections, a more suitable translation would be \"to worship and to obey.\" Man is put in the garden to worship and obedience; he was a priest, not merely a worker and keeper of the garden.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Genesis/Genesis2/#sailhamer","title":"sailhamer","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Genesis/Genesis2/#v16-17","title":"v.16-17","text":"<p>And the LORD God commanded the man, \"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; <sup>17</sup>but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.\"</p> <p>The inference is that God alone knows what is good for the man and what is not good for him. To enjoy the \"good\" man must trust God and obey him. If he disobeys, he will have to decide for himself what is good and what is not good.

In the narrative of the creation of the woman in ch.2, the author returns to develop this theme by showing that man's creation \"in God's image\" also entails a \"partnership\" (NIV, \"a suitable helper [GK 6469]\") with his wife. The \"likeness\" that the man and the woman share with God in ch.1 finds an analogy in the \"likeness\" between the man and his wife in ch.2. For the first time since the account of the creation of the man and the woman  in ch.1, there is divine deliberation. The plural \"Let us make\" is replaced by the singular \"I will make,\" perhaps because only the woman is being created.

He sends his Spirit to irradiate the darkened mind, to expostulate with the conscience, to prompt and strengthen holy resolve, and to bring back the heart, the confidence, the affection to God. He effects the blessed result of repentance toward God in some, who are thus proved to be born of God. But it is a solemn thought that with others he will not strive perpetually. There is a certain point beyond which he will not go, for sufficient reasons known fully to himself, partly to us. Two of these we are to notice for our instruction: First, he will not touch the free agency of his rational creatures. He can put no force on the volitions of men. An involuntary or compulsory faith, hope, love, obedience, is a contradiction in terms; and anything that could bear the name can have no moral validity whatsoever. Secondly, after giving ample warning, instruction, and invitation, he will, as a just judgment on the unbelieving and the impenitent, withdraw his Spirit and let them alone.

In Jeremiah 1 God is not \u201ctricking\u201d or \u201cdeceiving\u201d Jeremiah into anything, for God tells him clearly that his ministry will be difficult, and that he will face terrifying opposition (1:8, 17\u201319). The word used here in 20:7 can also mean \u201cto entice, seduce, persuade,\u201d and these concepts reflect the more likely connotations intended here. The next two words relate to strength (\u201coverpowered\u201d) and power/ability (\u201cprevailed\u201d). Taken together, what Jeremiah is saying in this verse is that he did not volunteer for this job; he was chosen by God, who did not really give him any choice about it. In Jeremiah 1 God swept away any objections that Jeremiah tried to make and insisted that Jeremiah become his prophet. So Jeremiah is griping to God about this, saying something like, \u201cYou forced me to be your prophet, and now I am being ridiculed, mocked, and threatened all the time.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah20/#jdanielhays-teachthetext","title":"jdanielhays #teachthetext","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah20/#v8","title":"v.8","text":"<p>Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction.

I will be their God, and they will be my people.</p> <p><sup>34</sup>No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\" declares the Lord.</p> <p>Yahweh's assertion that all the covenant people will know the Lord provides a profound shift in the definition of the elect. From Abraham onward the chosen nation has consisted of those who believe and nonfaithful persons, a situation that creates the notion of a remnant. Now, in effect, the whole covenant group will be believers, or what has been called the remnant up to now. All will receive the future blessings because none will fail to have had God place the covenant on their hearts. The unbelieving majority will no longer exist. This new group will receive the new city that Yahweh speaks of in Jeremiah 30-33.</p> <p>How this remnant or new covenant people comes to know Yahweh is also new in the Old Testament canon. God will instill this knowledge directly in their hearts, leaving nothing to chance. God will regenerate the heart so that the written law will be kept and the relationship to himself maintained. This action is foreshadowed in Deuteronomy 30:6, where it is said that Yahweh will circumcise the people's heart to know the Lord. Even the power to keep what has been instilled will come from the Lord. Therefore according Ronald Clements:     In this way a covenant, which is recognized by the tradition to be a bilateral obligation, becomes effectively a unilateral one, since God himself ensures the fulfillment of the obligations that he makes. It becomes synonymous in effect, though not in name, with a covenant of promise. If disobedience is removed, if God's will has been directly implanted in the heart, if sins are forgiven because of this process, then, von Rad correctly concludes, \"what is here outlined is the picture of a new man, a man who is able to obey perfectly because of a miraculous change of his nature.\" All the covenant people will fit this description.</p> <p>Since this covenant will tranform the definition of the covenant people, it cannot be broken, and it will therefore never cease. The greatest problem with the Mosaic covenant is always human disobedience, according to the canon. God's instruction is merciful and gracious, yet it is forgotten, spurned and rejected by all but the few. This new covenant cannot be rejected by a portion or a majority of the elect nation, since rejection betrays one's status as noncovenant person. Once all covenant people are faithful there will be no reason for the making of other covenants. This agreement will incorporate the everlasting covenants with Abraham and David and will stand forever. With these elements assured, details such as unity, internalization and forgiveness will be secured as well. God alone has the power to effect such change in the diseased hearts (cf. 17:9) Jeremiah observes in his day.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah31/#paulhouse-318-319","title":"paulhouse (318-319)","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah32/","title":"Jeremiah 32","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah32/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah32/#v1","title":"v.1","text":"<p>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah32/#v2","title":"v.2","text":"<p>The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah32/#v3","title":"v.3","text":"<p>Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, \"Why do you prophesy as you do?

Surprisingly, the actual fall of the city is described in very brief fashion (39:1\u20133). The focus of Jeremiah 39 is on the contrasting fates of those who were living in Jerusalem: Zedekiah and the nobles (39:4\u20137), the people (39:8\u201310), Jeremiah (39:11\u201314), and Ebed-Melek (39:15\u201318).</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah39/#jdanielhays-teachthetext","title":"jdanielhays #teachthetext","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah39/#v1","title":"v.1","text":"<p>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah39/#v2","title":"v.2","text":"<p>And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year, the city wall was broken through.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah39/#v3","title":"v.3","text":"<p>Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah39/#v4","title":"v.4","text":"<p>When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah.</p> <p>The word translated as \u201cleft\u201d (yatsa\u2019) is the same word used in 38:17\u201318, where it is translated as \u201csurrender.\u201d Note the ironic wordplay taking place.

First, loving-kindness. This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination \"loving-kindness and faithfulness\" (Psalm 85:10, corrected version), and as here (comp. Psalm 5:7, 8; Psalm 36:5, 6), \"mercy and righteousness.\" Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his \"loving-kindness,\" vouchsafes. Next, judgment, or justice. Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. Jeremiah 21:12). Then, righteousness - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence \"righteousness\" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the \"plan of salvation.\" It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah9/#pulpitcommentary","title":"pulpitcommentary","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Jeremiah/Jeremiah9/#v","title":"v.","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Job/Job1/","title":"Job 1","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Job/Job1/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":"<p>Job in Hebrew \u2192 persecuted, he that weeps, cries out of a hollow place, one who turns to God.

His indignation, then, is not the carrying out of vengeance but rather the working out of forgiveness, for these are his word: \"If you shall turn and lament, you shall be saved.\" He waits for our lamentations here, that is, in time, that he may spare us those that shall be eternal. He waits for our tears that he may pour forth his goodness. So in the Gospel having pity on the tears of the widow, he raised her son. He waits for our conversion that he may himself restore us to grace, which would have continued with us had no fall overtaken us. But he is angry because we have by our sins incurred guilt in order that we may be humbled; we are humbled in order that we may be found worthy rather of pity than of punishment. Jeremiah, too, may certainly teach us this when he says, \"For the Lord will not cast off forever; for after he has humbled, he will have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies, he who has not humbled from his whole heart or cast off the children of humankind.\" This passage we certainly find in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and from it, and from what follows, we note that the Lord humbles all the prisoners of the earth under his feet, in order that we may escape his judgement. But the one who does not bring down the sinner even to the earth with his whole heart is also the one who raises the poor even from the dust and the needy from the dunghill. For he does not wholeheartedly bring down those he intends to forgive. But if he does not wholeheartedly bring down every sinner, how much less does he wholeheartedly bring down someone who has not sinned with his whole heart! For as he said of the Jews, \"This people honors with me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,\" so perhaps he may say of some of the fallen, \"They denied me with their lips, but in their heart they are with me. It was pain that overcame them, not unfaithfulness that turned them aside.\" But some without cause refuse pardon to those whose faith the persecutor himself confessed up to the point of striving to overcome it by torture. They denied the Lord once but confess him daily; they denied in word but confess him with groans, with cries and with tears; they confess him with willing words, not under compulsion. They yielded, indeed, for a moment to the temptation of the devil, but even the devil afterwards left those whom he was unable to claim as his own. He yielded to their weeping, he yielded to their repentance, and after making them his own lost those whom he attached when they belonged to Another.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#ambrose","title":"ambrose","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#v38","title":"v.38","text":"<p>Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come?</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#v39","title":"v.39","text":"<p>Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?</p> <p>If I hate sin because of the punishment, I have not repented of my sin, I merely regret that God is just.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#spurgeon_4","title":"spurgeon","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#v44","title":"v.44","text":"<p>You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#v48","title":"v.48","text":"<p>Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#v51","title":"v.51","text":"<p>What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Lamentations/Lamentations3/#v57","title":"v.57","text":"<p>You came near when I called you, and you said, \"Do not fear.\"</p> <p>How powerful is this word when spoken by the Spirit of the Lord to a disconsolate heart.

So the Septuagint: \"the sacrifice of praise glorifies me.\" So the Vulgate. The idea is, that the worship which God requires is \"praise;\" it is not the mere external act of homage; it is not the presentation of a bloody sacrifice; it is not the mere bending of the knee; it is not a mere outward form: it is that which proceeds from the heart, and which shows that there is there a spirit of true thankfulness, adoration, and love.</p> <p>And to him that ordereth his conversation aright - Margin, as in Hebrew, \"that disposeth his way.\" Or, more literally, \"To him that \"prepares\" or \"plans\" his way;\" that is, to him who is attentive to his going; who seeks to walk in the right path; who is anxious to go in the road that leads to a happier world; who is careful that all his conduct shall be in accordance with the rules which God has prescribed.</p> <p>Will I show the salvation of God - This may mean either, \"I, the author of the psalm as a teacher\" (compare Psalm 32:8); or, \"I\" as referring to God - as a promise that \"He\" would instruct such an one.

The \"idea\" here is, that where there is a true desire to find the way of truth and salvation, God will impart needful instruction. He will not suffer such an one to wander away and be lost. See the notes at Psalm 25:9.</p> <p>The general ideas in the psalm, therefore, are</p> <p>(1) that there is to be a solemn judgment of mankind;</p> <p>(2) that the issues of that judgment will not be determined by the observance of the external forms of religion;</p> <p>(3) that God will judge people impartially for their sins, though they observe those forms of religion; and</p> <p>(4) that no worship of God can be acceptable which does not spring from the heart.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Psalms/Psalm50/#barnes-legacystandard","title":"barnes #legacystandard","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Psalms/Psalm51/","title":"Psalm 51","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Psalms/Psalm51/#overview","title":"Overview:","text":""},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Psalms/Psalm51/#v11","title":"v.11","text":"<p>Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.</p>"},{"location":"Old%20Testament/Psalms/Psalm51/#v12","title":"v.12","text":"<p>Restore to the me the joy of your salvation, and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.</p> <p>\"Cause the joy of thy salvation to return.\" This implies that he had formerly known what was the happiness of being a friend of God, and of having a hope of salvation.

Costly and difficult work needs to be done. Such labor cannot be sustained by the fleeting, momentary zeal generated by appeals for desperate, perishing souls.

The basis of the Great Commission is rooted in the authority of Jesus through his presence with his followers, a major stress in Matthew since it begins and ends with this theme (1:23; 28:20). (86) 1. Where the author places certain verses affects its meaning. The culmination of Matthew is 28:17-20 where the readers hear how the now eleven disciples still struggled to trust Jesus and grasp who he truly is. Matthew describes the disciples with \"little faith\" five times.  (86) 1. Determinacy means that interpretations can be weighed on the basis of their alignment and coherence with an author's communicative intention. It means that, in interpretative theory, we can describe and explore the limits of meaning (we can affirm its bounded nature). (87) 2. Each time we return to the text we are different: we ask different questions, we bring different issues, we arrive at different insights. Our contextualizing of the text occurs between the textual world and our world, and this interaction helps to explain our experience of flux in relation to meaning. (88) 3. Although we cannot access meaning perfectly, we should still try to reach for it. Some may argue that truth is relative since no human can know truth in any objective fashion. Others who claim the existence of objective truth also posit the existence of objective knowledge\u2014meaning we can view truth from an objective vantage point. To avoid extremes, we clearly distinguish between objective truth or reality and the always-subjective human appropriation of truth (89). 4.  John may be using ambiguous wordplay in John 1:5 when he says the darkness has not katalamban\u00f3 it. It can be translated as either \"understood\" or \"overcome.\" In 12:35, darkness overcomes the light but misunderstanding is a Johannine motif (8:27). (92) 2. In John 3, he plays on the word an\u00f3then which can mean either \"from above\" or \"again.\" Jesus says a person must be born from above (3:3; confirmed at 3:12-13), while Nicodemus misunderstands and gets preoccupied by the literal notion of being born again (3:4). (93) 3. There is a probably wordplay on z\u014dn when Jesus offers \"living water\" but the Samaritan woman may have misheard as \"running water.\" (93) 4. We need to be aware of our cultural gaps from the Bible when we approach the text. Most ascribe Jonah's running away from God's call to cowardice. However this does not come from the text\u2014only the fear of God is mentioned in 1:9. His real reason is made apparent when understanding the social world of his day. Jonah, an Israelite, flees God's command to preach at the capital city of Israel's archenemy out of hatred of his enemies as well as knowing God would show mercy if they repented. (93-94) 5. Most of us in the West tend to individualistically read 1 Corinthians 3:16 hearing the singular \"you\" when Paul says \"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?\" (NASB). What's surprising is that Paul is referring to the corporate church as God's temple and dwelling place for God's Spirit\u2014clearly indicated from his usage of the second-person plural form (\"you\") in the Greek. (94) 6. In my reading, Paul's central concern in 1 Corinthians 8 is the Corinthian's participation in idolatry as they join in temple feasts. \ud83d\udd25The root problem is idolatry, specifically, attempting to affirm one's allegiance to the one true God, while playing at the edges of idolatrous practice, when the call of God is to exclusive allegiance\ud83d\udd25. This normative stance seems quite transferable to my cultural context, since today's contemporary church struggles with compromised allegiance, as did the Corinthian church, although not in relation to temple feasts. For instance, the siren song of materialism woos us from wholehearted allegiance to God toward placing possessions, money, and comfort at the center of our existence. The normative song of resistance to idolatrous temptations resonates well in this different key.

Particularly helpful is the observation that, by citing a brief part of another text or even alluding to it, an author may be evoking the entire context, message, or story of that other text. One example is the recognition that an important way the Gospel writers communicate the fulfillment of Israel's promised restoration in Jesus is by evoking Isaiah's \"new exodus\" motif (e.g. Matt. 1-2; Mark 1:1-3)\u2026 this way of evoking whole stories and ideas by means of allusion makes much sense of how we understand New Testament writers using Old Testament texts. (110) 1. Terms     1. Locution - a saying/utterance     2. Illocution  - what the saying does     3. Perlocution - response of a hearer 2. EXAMPLE:     1. I call out to Libby, \"Watch out for the geese!\" (locution)     2. The illocutionary act is an act of warning and want to elicit a certain response from Libby (perlocution).     3. If Libby understands my warning, my illocution is successful.     4. If Libby move away from the geese, my perlocutionary intention will have been successful. 3. In the end, how are these distinctions important for interpreting the Bible? They are important because, as is so often the case, the writers of Scripture have perlocutionary intentions for their audience beyond understanding what is communicated. Biblical authors certainly want to be understood when they warn and exhort and plead and praise. Yet they also have intentions for their audience that go beyond simply understanding what they are saying and doing with their words. The authors have as extensions of their communicative intentions the shaping of their audience to respond in certain ways. They warn so that their audience will be deterred from harm; they exhort so that their audience will follow the paths they set forth; they praise God\u2014and implicitly invite their audience into of God with them.

What we see when we think we are looking into the depths of Scripture may sometimes be only the reflection of our own silly faces. - C.S. Lewis (120) 2. Presupposition - any preconception that is part of our thinking as we come to interpret the Bible. 3. \"[Presuppositions] can enable creative and penetrating insight... [yet] the same commitments may also lead to eisegesis, selective blindness, and dubious ranking of [textual] elements as central or peripheral.\" (123)     1. Tuner, \"Theological Hermeneutics,\" 57-58. As you may hear, the word \"eisegesis\" is related to \"exegesis.\" While exegesis is a \"drawing out\" of the author's meaning, eisegesis refers to imparting one's own meaning into the text.    4. Presuppositions \"gone bad\" are what Osborne refers to as prejudices. A prejudice is the denigration of a presupposition into an \"a priori grid\" that then predetermines what the text can or cannot mean. A prejudice, by definition, does not budge even when presented with powerful textual evidence to the contrary. Instead, a prejudice forces the text into alignment with its own position. (123) 5. \ud83d\udd25Trying to discover our presuppositions can be rather like trying to see our own blind spots\u2014very difficult without outside assistance. The Spirit's work in our lives, the influence of the larger Christian community, and the Scriptures themselves when read with a submissive spirit are central correctives to our potential prejudices. (123) 6. The reader's misreading is not a part of the text's meaning. (124) 7. Reading the Bible is a cross-cultural experience and inextricably has an \"otherness\" to it. 8. \ud83d\udd25If we are routinely experiencing the Bible as \"nonthreatening platitudes\" rather than a wake-up call to new ways of thinking, being, and doing, we are probably not reading well. (125) 9. The Bible is meta-cognitive in scope. So our reading of it should allow for the entire range of responses it envisions for readers, cognitive and otherwise. To read only for the cognitive knowledge we can get from the Bible diminishes its value and purposes. Part of allowing Scripture to shape us is submitting to it not only with our minds but also with our affections and our actions. Only in this way will we truly and personally know. (128) 10. There is no one-to-one correspondence between personal piety and correct interpretation, although this conviction is sometimes used as a trump card for interpretive correctness (\"I prayed and God told me that this passage means...\").

The author's choice of genre is a primary part of the communicative choices. 1. While in an epistle an author seeks to persuade through a course of reasoning that is fairly explicit and often linear, narrative authors do their \"persuading\" most often implicitly, through story and point of view. (140) 1. Hebrew poetry does not share characteristics like rhyme and meter with English poetry, but it does also utilize alliteration, assonance, onomatopoeia, and wordplay. 2. As A. Berkeley Mickelson has warned, \"The very essence of poetry is destroyed if we are absorbed in the mechanics of it.\" (148) 3. In poetry, authors select words for their sound, form, and metaphorical qualities which contribute to poetry's compactness compared to prose. David in Psalm 51 uses a dozen occurrences of five different words to describe sin. It would be a misreading to look too deeply into these five instances and emphasize its nuances. 4. Yet the inclusion of individual lament psalms in the Psalter implies that these personal expressions were valued and used by the wider community of Israel\u2014that they were communicative. In fact, even now they continue to resonate with believers who face overwhelming situations. \ud83d\udd25The laments, even while expressing anger and despair, are set in the context of a stance of trust; they are, after all, addressed to God. They assume the presence of God, even while mourning God's apparent absence. Because of their faith stance, they speak beyond the psalmist's particular self expression to communicate passionately and powerfully with hearers and readers. (150) 1. Since we are so familiar with the epistle genre, due to our daily interaction with emails and letters, we can be lulled into a complacent reading of the Epistles. There tends to be more sermons on Paul than on the Gospels or the OT in non-liturgical evangelical settings. 1. Brown uses the example of sending an introductory email of a seminary course she'll be teaching. It's quite lengthy to cut out any need for inference or implications. Paul and other NT letter writers assumed a lot from their readers since they were picking up their communication in relational midstream. 2. The one part of the form of ancient letters we are not used to is a thanksgiving section that was typically included. This section might be rather extensive or simply a prayer for the recipient's good health. Paul, in fact, usually extends the expected thanksgiving section, so that it is quite developed. Knowing these conventions helps us feel the effect of his omission of a thanksgiving in his letter to the Galatians. Paul moves directly from his greeting to the body of the letter \"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel\" (1:6 NRSV). The omission, which may not seem so significant to modern readers, would almost certainly have been felt by the Galatian Christians. (151) 3. The truth is that we always provide a social context for what we read; we do so automatically. (152) 4. An example of automatically providing social context is reading Paul's exhortations about Communion in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34. If we think they did Communion by passing a small grape juice cap and cracker, we will have read the text with our own setting mind. In reality, ancient Corinth conducted Communion as a full meal. 5. We can also potentially overconstruct the situation, a procedure that has been called \"mirror reading.\" Mirror reading is the determination that each command or argument of a letter is tied to a specific problem being experienced by the audience of the letter. (154) 6. An example is how early reconstructionist dated 1 Peter to a time under Nero's reign due to the phrase \"fiery ordeal\" in 4:12. This term does not necessitate literal fire and concluding the epistle's written date from such slim evidence would be an example of mirror reading. 7. Matthew groups together a number of miracles together in chapters 8-9, which are sequenced differently in Mark/Luke to emphasize Jesus' authority over sickness, nature, and sin to fulfill Israel's hope for resurrection.</p>"},{"location":"Reading%20Journals/Scripture%20As%20Communication/Part2/#the-language-of-the-bible","title":"The Language of the Bible","text":"<p>Pages 166-188 1. There is nothing archaic, solemn or mystical about the kind of language used by the inspired authors of the New Testament. It is the Greek of the street.

Just as God took on the form of common humanity when he revealed himself as the living Word, so his written Word was revealed in language that the person on the street could understand.  - Mark Strauss, Distorting Scripture?

Understanding language as created and so secondary has a number of implications. First, that God has created language implies that language is adequate for the task of communication and theology. (170) 3. . Good exegesis is much more about listening carefully to the whole movement of a discourse, rather than isolating individual words for study. As I frequently tell students: It's better to be a good English exegete than a poor Greek or Hebrew one. (176) 1. We do not understand a culture through its language.     1. it is simply wrongheaded to assume that particular characteristics of a people group correspond to \"patterns in the linguistic structure when analysed itself.\" (178) 2. NT authors may use the same term with different senses: James uses pistis as affirmation of Christian truth (which demons exhibit) and Paul uses it as trust. 1. The less familiar we are with a language, the more likely we are to treat it artificially. (182) 1. Linguistic Pitfalls to Avoid     1. Don't infer the meaning of a word from its etymology.     2. Don't infer the meaning of a word from its later usage.         1. An example is how we define the term martyr.     3. Don't read all possible meanings of a word into a specific usage.         1. It essentially collapses the norms of language (all possible meanings of a word) into the norms of utterance (the specific meaning intended in an utterance). (186)     4. Don't overemphasize fine points of grammar. 2. God created language as good but sin has tainted our ability to fully understand it and avoid misunderstandings. Yet, God uses human language as a vehicle of his perfect truth.</p>"},{"location":"Reading%20Journals/Scripture%20As%20Communication/Part2/#the-social-world-of-the-bible","title":"The Social World of the Bible","text":"<p>Pages 189-211 1. \"There is an innate laziness which affects us all: the sense of 'd'you mean I've got to learn all that stuff about first-century Judaism just to get the simple gospel message?'

We need to mind the gap between our understanding of the culture we live and the one the characters of the Bible lived in. 3. Levels of context     1. World Context: we all understand \"light\" and \"dark\" metaphors like in Psalm 119:105.     2. Cultural Context: professional mourners for the death of a loved one was a Hebrew practice (Amos 5:16)         1.

Audience Context: the original audience of Malachi was the post-exile people of Judah who were familiar with the abuses of the Levitical priesthood.     4. Dynamic Context: the evolving relationship between the author of a text and the intended audience like Paul's letters to the Corinthians. 4. The author of Genesis may have been aware of other cosmologies like the Mesopotamian Enuma Elish. If so, we can read other ancient near eastern sources to construct what their social world resembled. 5. Four categories of intertestamental/Second Temple writings:     1. Jewish Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha     2. Philo and Josephus     3. Dead Sea Scrolls     4. Rabbinic literature 6. There were distinct \"Judaisms\" around in the first century: Pharisees, Essenes, Sadducees, etc. 7. The interplay between Jewish belief/practice and Greco-Roman culture is best exemplified by the fact that the crucifixion was a \"Roman form of imperial control and execution used to remove troublesome members of the empire.\" (199) 1. Be ready to hear presuppositions quite different from your own as you read. Whenever you read something that strikes you as odd, assume that the idea in question actually makes sense within the worldview of the writer. (200) 1. One ancient author may hold a viewpoint not shared widely by everyone else. At Qumran, they expected two Messianic figures (Messiah of Israel and Messiah of Aaron) but most first century Jews didn't think so. 2. A Bible Atlas can help us learn that Amos is from the southern kingdom of Judah who prophecies against places in the northern kingdom of Israel. This explains why in 7:12 Amos to treated as an outsider. 3. Cautions:     1. Underconstructing the Setting         1. We need to know the literary context of Amos to understand Amos 4:4 as ironic since Israel's worship was not pleasing to God due to their unjust treatment of one another.     2. Overconstructing the Setting     3. Overgeneralizing about the Social Context         1. Anytime we assert \"All Israelites though or did this\" or \"All first-century people believed this\" we overgeneralize.         2. \"All Pharisees were legalists\" is another example of overgeneralization. 4. As we look at the Old Testament, we see that the Torah was never intended to provide a way for Israel to earn God's approval (one aspect of the popular definition of legalism). God gave the law so that Israel would know how to live in the covenant relationship God had already established with them through Abraham and reaffirmed in their redemption from Egypt. Law was understood within the context of covenant. First-century Judaism was no more prone to legalism than any other religion, including twenty-first century Christianity! (208) 5. Pharisees were like Bible camp counselors who gave the famous pep-talk on the last night to urge campers to not lose the fire when they return home from camp. 6. The point of contention between Jesus and the Pharisees is over the interpretation of the law\u2014not legalism. Matthew 23:23 demonstrates Jesus directing the Pharisees to heed weightier matters of the Torah without neglecting the rest of the law.</p>"},{"location":"Reading%20Journals/Scripture%20As%20Communication/Part2/#literary-context-intertextuality-and-canon","title":"Literary Context, Intertextuality, and Canon","text":"<p>Pages 212-231 1. Reading 1 Corinthians 13 in context of chapters 11-14 reveals Paul's assessment that they are using spiritual gifts without love. 1. Picking out parts of Scripture for our reading is like taking a friend's letter and reading the middle paragraph today and the introductory section two months later. 1. Proof-texting is taking a Bible verse out of its literary context to fit into a framework of interpretation: \"the smallest atoms of the text are torn away from their textual... contexts and reassembled within some other framework of interpretation, often in order to demonstrate a point that is anything but natural to them.\" (214) 2. While Philippians 4:13 probably has been used to claim strength for any number of endeavors, in the immediate context Paul is interested in one particular Christian attitude\u2014contentment (4:10-19). (215) 3. A common usage of proof-texting are in Bible studies where a conclusion of a certain topic is stated preceding surveying particular verses that prove the point. There is a tendency to assume a certain way of reading the text rather interpreting them in their literary contexts. 1. Themes that appear as \"bookends\" are inclusios. 1. In John's Gospel, themes are combined with particular Jewish festival settings to emphasize some aspects of Jesus' identity in relation to his followers. For instance, the setting of John 6 is the Jewish Passover, in which unleavened bread plays an important role (see Exod. 12:1-20). The Passover becomes the setting for Jesus' feeding of the five thousand (John 6:1-15), his claim to be the bread of life (6:35; see 6:32-33), and the dialogue that surrounds this claim (6:25-59). Thus, the motif of bread, the Passover setting, and the controversy around Jesus' claim to be the bread of life all work together to highlight Jesus' identity and role as the sustenance of his people (see John 6:53-58). (220) 1. The choice of genre is fundamental to the fulfillment of these authorial purposes. (221) 2. Exegetical skills for studying literary context:     1. Outlining a book     2. Summarizing     3. Identifying themes     4. Identifying the function of a particular text in relation to its literary context 3. Intertextuality     1. The verb \"remember\" in 1 Samuel 1:19 is also used in Genesis and Exodus for activities tied to God's covenant. The reader, knowing this, would hear covenantal overtones in the birth story of Samuel. 4. All of Scripture together points to a coherent picture of God's redemptive work in creation and humanity.

Brown's students read Genesis and were put off by reading about Lot's incest. We may have been trained to emulate what we read in narrative, but that's why understanding genre is important for the interpretive process. 2.

The radical consequence of the incarnation is that human knowledge of God cannot be ahistorical. (259) - Zimmerman, Recovering Theological Hermeneutics, 163-164 4.

He searches for friends upon whose garments he can detect the smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces, and finding few or none he, like Mary of old, keeps these things in his heart.</p> <p>It is this very loneliness that throws him back upon God. \"When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.\" His inability to find human companionship drives him to seek in God what he can find nowhere else. He learns in inner solitude what he could not have learned in the crowd that Christ is All in All, that He is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption, that in Him we have and possess life's summum bonum.</p> <p>Two things remain to be said. One, that the lonely man of whom we speak is not a haughty man, nor is he the holier-than-thou, austere saint so bitterly satirized in popular literature. He is likely to feel that he is the least of all men and is sure to blame himself for his very loneliness. He wants to share his feelings with others and to open his heart to some like-minded soul who will understand him, but the spiritual climate around him does not encourage it, so he remains silent and tells his griefs to God alone.</p> <p>The second thing is that the lonely saint is not the withdrawn man who hardens himself against human suffering and spends his days contemplating the heavens. Just the opposite is true. His loneliness makes him sympathetic to the approach of the broken-hearted and the fallen and the sin-bruised. Because he is detached from the world he is all the more able to help it. Meister Eckhart taught his followers that if they should find themselves in prayer as it were caught up to the third heavens and happen to remember that a poor widow needed food, they should break off the prayer instantly and go care for the widow. \"God will not suffer you to lose anything by it,\" he told them. \"You can take up again in prayer where you left off and the Lord will make it up to you.\" This is typical of the great mystics and masters of the interior life from Paul to the present day.</p> <p>The weakness of so many modern Christians is that they feel too much at home in the world. In their effort to achieve restful \"adjustment\" to unregenerate society they have lost their pilgrim character and become an essential part of the very moral order against which they are sent to protest.

The reality is that only God the CREATOR of your own heart possesses the deftness to be able to navigate around all the layers we have built up inside.

If you are feeling lonely but you are not revealing or being vulnerable about this to anyone, then you will stay lonely. Being vulnerable and leaving room for close brothers/sisters to pour into us in times of weakness allows the Holy Spirit more room to increase the measure of His Spirit in us. (Ephesians 1:17-19, 2 Corinthians 12:9, Philippians 3:7-10, John 3:30)</p> </li> <li> <p>Choose joy.

He is a prisoner in Rome, all but forsaken by his friends, in hourly expectation of another summons before Nero. To appear before him was, he says, like putting his head into \u2018the mouth of the lion.\u2019 His horizon was darkened by sad anticipations of decaying faith and growing corruptions in the Church. What a road he had travelled since that day when, on the way to Damascus, he saw the living Christ, and heard the words of His mouth!  </p> <p>It had been but a failure of a life, if judged by ordinary standards. He had suffered the loss of all things, had thrown away position and prospects, had exposed himself to sorrows and toils, had been all his days a poor man and solitary, had been hunted, despised, laughed at by Jew and Gentile, worried and badgered even by so-called brethren, \ud83d\udc94loved the less, the more he loved. And now the end is near. A prison-and the-headsman\u2019s sword are the world\u2019s wages to its best teacher. When Nero is on the throne, the only possible place for Paul is a dungeon opening on to the scaffold. Better to be the martyr than the Caesar!</p> <p>These familiar words of our text bring before us a very sweet and wonderful picture of the prisoner, so near his end. How beautifully they show his calm waiting for the last hour and the bright forms which lightened for him the darkness of his cell! Many since have gone to their rest with their hearts stayed On the same thoughts, though their lips could not speak them to our listening ears. Let us be thankful for them, and pray that for ourselves, when we come to that hour, the same quiet heroism and the same sober hope mounting to calm certainty may be ours.  </p> <p>These words refer to the past, the present, the future. \u2018I have fought - the time of my departure is come - henceforth there is laid up.\u2019  </p> <p>I. So we notice, first, the quiet courage which looks death full in the face without a tremor. </p> <p>The language implies that Paul knows his death hour is all but here. As the Revised Version more accurately gives it, \u2018I am already being offered\u2019 - the process is begun, his sufferings at the moment are, as it were, the initial steps of his sacrifice - \u2018and the time of my departure is come.\u2019 The tone in which he tells Timothy this is very noticeable. There is no sign of excitement, no tremor of emotion, no affectation of stoicism in the simple sentences. He is not playing up to a part, nor pretending to be anything which he is not. If ever language sounded perfectly simple and genuine, this does.  </p> <p>And the occasion of the .whole section is as remarkable as the tone. He is led to speak about himself at all, only in order to enforce his exhortation to Timothy to put his shoulder to the wheel, and do his work for Christ with all his might. All he wishes to say is simply, do your work with all your might, for I am going off the field. But having begun on that line of thought, he is carried on to say more than was needed for his immediate purpose, and thus inartificially to let us see what was filling his mind.  </p> <p>And the subject into which he subsides after these lofty thoughts is as remarkable as either tone or occasion. Minute directions about such small matters as books and parchments, and perhaps a warm cloak for winter, and homely details about the movements of the little group of his friends immediately follow. All this shows with what a perfectly unforced courage Paul fronted his fate, and looked death in the eyes. The anticipation did not dull his interest in God\u2019s work in the world, as witness the warnings and exhortations of the context. It did not withdraw his sympathies from his companions. It did not hinder him from pursuing his studies and pursuits, nor from providing for small matters of daily convenience. If ever a man was free from any taint of fanaticism or morbid enthusiasm, it was this man waiting so calmly in his prison for his death.  </p> <p>There is great beauty and force in the expressions which he uses for death here. He will not soil his lips with its ugly name, but calls it an offering and a departure. There is a widespread unwillingness to say the word \u2018 Death.\u2019 It falls on men\u2019s hearts like clods on a coffin. So all people and languages have adopted euphemisms for it, fair names which wrap silk round its dart and somewhat hide its face. But there are two opposite reasons for their use - terror and confidence. Some men dare not speak of death because they dread it so much, and try to put some kind of shield between themselves and the very thought of it, by calling it something less dreadful to them than itself. Some men, on the other hand, are familiar with the thought, and though it is solemn, it is not altogether repellent to them.  </p> <p>Gazing on death with the thoughts and feelings which Jesus Christ has given them concerning it, they see it in new aspects, which take away much of its blackness. And so they do not feel inclined to use the ugly old name, but had rather call it by some which reflect the gentler aspect that it now wears to them. So \u2018sleep,\u2019 and \u2018rest\u2019 and the like are the names which have almost driven the other out of the New Testament - witness of the fact that in inmost reality Jesus Christ \u2018has abolished death,\u2019 however the physical portion of it may still remain master of our bodies.  </p> <p>But looking for a moment at the specific metaphors used here, we have first, that of an offering, or more particularly of a drink offering, or libation, \u2018I am already being poured out.\u2019 No doubt the special reason for the selection of this figure here is Paul\u2019s anticipation of a violent death. The shedding of his blood was to be an offering poured out like some costly wine upon the altar, but the power of the figure reaches far beyond that special application of it. We may all make our deaths a sacrifice, an offering to God, for we may yield up our will to God\u2019s will, and so turn that last struggle into an act of worship and self surrender. When we recognise His hand, when we submit our wills to His purposes, when \u2018we live unto the Lord,\u2019 if we live, and \u2018die unto Him,\u2019 if we die, then Death will lose all its terror and most of its pain, and will become for us what it was to Paul, a true offering up of self in thankful worship. Nay, we may even say, that so we shall in a certain subordinate sense be \u2018made conformable unto His death\u2019 who committed His spirit into His Father\u2019s hands, and laid down His life, of His own will. The essential character and far-reaching effects of this sacrifice we cannot imitate, but we can so yield up our wills to God and leave life so willingly and trustfully as that death shall make our sacrifice complete.  </p> <p>Another more familiar and equally striking figure is next used, when Paul speaks of the time of his \u2018departure.\u2019 The thought is found in most tongues. Death is a going away, or, as Peter calls it {with a glance, possibly, at the special meaning of the word in the Old Testament, as well as at its use in the solemn statement of the theme of converse on the Mountain of Transfiguration}, an Exodus. But the well-worn image receives new depth and sharpness of outline in Christianity. To those who have learned the meaning of Christ\u2019s resurrection, and feed their souls on the hopes which it warrants, Death is merely a change of place or state, an accident affecting locality, and little more. We have had plenty of changes before. Life has been one long series of departures. This is different from the others mainly in that it is the last, and that to go away from this visible and fleeting show, where we wander aliens among things which have no true kindred with us, is to go home, where there will be no more pulling up the tent-pegs, and toiling across the deserts in monotonous change. How strong is the conviction, spoken in this name for death, that the essential life lasts on quite unaltered through it all! How slight the else formidable thing is made! We may change climates, and for the stormy bleakness of life may have the long still days of heaven, but we do not change ourselves. We lose nothing worth keeping when we leave behind the body, as a dress not fitted for home, where we are going. We but travel one more stage, though it be the last, and part of it be in pitchy darkness. Some pass over it as in a fiery chariot, like Paul and many a martyr. Some have to toil through it with slow steps and bleeding feet and fainting heart; but all may have a Brother with them, and, holding His hand, may find that the journey is not so hard as they feared, and the home from which they shall remove no more, better than they hoped when they hoped the most.  </p> <p>II. We have here, too, the peaceful look backwards. There is something very noteworthy in the threefold aspect under which his past life presents itself to the Apostle who is so soon to leave it. He thinks of it as a contest, as a race, as a stewardship. The first image suggests the tension of a long struggle with opposing wrestlers who have tried to throw him, but in vain. The world, both of men and things, has had to be grappled with and mastered. His own sinful nature and especially his animal nature has had to be kept under by sheer force, and every moment has been resistance to subtle omnipresent forces that have sought to thwart his aspirations and hamper his performances. His successes have had to be fought for, and everything that he has done has been done after a struggle. So is it with all noble life; so will it be to the end. </p> <p>He thinks of life as a race. That speaks of continuous advance in one direction, and more emphatically still, of effort that sets the lungs panting and strains every muscle to the utmost. He thinks of it as a stewardship. He has kept the faith {whether by that word we are to understand the body of truth believed or the act of believing} as a sacred deposit committed to him, of which he has been a good steward, and which he is now ready to return to his Lord. There is much in these letters to Timothy about keeping treasures entrusted to one\u2019s care. Timothy is bid to \u2018keep that good thing which is committed to thee,\u2019 as Paul here declares that he has done. Nor is such guarding of a precious deposit confined to us stewards on earth, but the Apostle is sure that his loving Lord, to whom he has entrusted himself, will with like tenderness and carefulness \u2018keep that which he has committed unto Him against that day.\u2019 The confidence in that faithful Keeper made it possible for Paul to be faithful to his trust, and as a steward who was bound by all ties to his Lord, to guard His possessions and administer His affairs. Life was full of voices urging him to give up the faith. Bribes and threats, and his own sense-bound nature, and the constant whispers of the world had tempted him all along the road to fling it away as a worthless thing, but he had kept it safe; and now, nearing the end and the account, he can put his hand on the secret place near his heart where it lies, and feel that it is there, ready to be restored to his Lord, with the thankful confession, \u2018Thy pound hath gained ten pounds.\u2019  </p> <p>So life looks to this man in his retrospect as mainly a field for struggle, effort, and fidelity. This world is not to be for us an enchanted garden of delights, any more than it should appear a dreary desert of disappointment and woe. But it should be to us mainly a palaestra, or gymnasium and exercising ground. You cannot expect many flowers or much grass in the place where men wrestle and run. We need not much mind though it be bare, if we can only stand firm on the hard earth, nor lament that there are so few delights to stay our eyes from the goal. We are here for serious work; let us not be too eager for pleasures that may hinder our efforts and weaken our vigour, but be content to lap up a hasty draught from the brooks by the way, and then on again to the fight.</p> <p>Prosaic theologians have sometimes wondered at the estimate which Paul here makes of his past services and faithfulness, but the wonder is surely unnecessary. It is very striking to notice the difference between his judgment of himself while he was still in the thick of the conflict, and now when he is nearing the end. Then one main hope which animated all his toils and nerved him for the sacrifice of life itself was \u2018that I might finish my course with joy.\u2019 Now in the quiet of his dungeon, that hope is fulfilled, and triumphant thoughts, like shining angels, keep him company in his solitude. Then he struggled, and wrestled, touched by the haunting fear lest after that he has preached to others he himself should be rejected. Now the dread has passed, and a meek hope stands by his side.</p> <p>What is this change of feeling but an instance of what, thank God, we so often see, that at the end the heart, which has been bowed with fears and self-depreciation, is filled with peace? They who tremble most during the conflict are most likely to look back with solid satisfaction, while they who never knew a fear all along the course will often have them surging in upon their souls too late, and will see the past in a new lurid light, when they are powerless to change it. Blessed is the man who thus feareth always. At the end he will have hope. The past struggles are joyful in memory, as the mountain ranges, which were all black reek and white snow while we toiled up their inhospitable steeps, lie purple in the mellowing distance, and burn like fire as the sunset strikes their peaks. Many a wild winter\u2019s day has a fair, cloudless close, and lingering opal hues diffused through all the quiet sky. \u2018At eventide it shall be light.\u2019 Though we go all Our lives mourning and timid, there may yet be granted us ere the end some vision of the true significance of these lives, and some humble hope that they have not been wholly in vain.</p> <p>Such an estimate has nothing in common with self-complacency. It co-exists with a profound consciousness of many a sin, many a defeat, and much unfaithfulness. It belongs only to a man who, conscious of these, is \u2018looking for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life,\u2019 and is the direct result, not the antagonist, of lowly self-abasement, and contrite faith in Him by whom alone our stained selves and poor broken services can ever be acceptable. Let us learn too that the only life that bears being looked back upon is a life of Christian devotion and effort. It shows fairer when seen in the strange cross lights that come when we stand on the boundary of two worlds, with the white radiance of eternity beginning to master the vulgar oil lamps of earth, than when seen by these alone. All others have their shabbiness and their selfishness disclosed then. I remember ones seeing a mob of revellers streaming out from a masked ball in a London theatre in the early morning sunlight; draggled and heavy-eyed, the rouge showing on the cheeks, and the shabby tawdriness of the foolish costumes pitilessly revealed by the pure light. So will many a life look when the day dawns, and the wild riot ends in its unwelcome beams.</p> <p>The one question for us all, then, will be, Have I lived for Christ, and by Him? Let it be the one question for us now, and let it be answered, Yes. Then we shall have at the last a calm confidence, equally far removed from presumption and from dread, which will let us look back on life with peace, though it be full of failures and sins, and forward with humble hope of the reward which we shall receive from His mercy.</p> <p>III. The climax of all is the triumphant look forward. \u2018Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.\u2019</p> <p>That crown is \u2018a crown of righteousness\u2019 in another sense from that in which it is \u2018a crown of life.\u2019 The latter expression indicates the material, if we may say so, of which it is woven, but the former rather points to the character to which it belongs or is given. Righteousness alone can receive that reward. It is not the struggle or the conflict which wins it, but the character evolved in the struggle, not the works of strenuous service, but the moral nature expressed in these. There is such a congruity between righteousness and the crown of life, that it can be laid on none other head but that of a righteous man, and if it could, all its amaranthine flowers would shrivel and fall when they touched an impure brow. It is, then, the crown of righteousness, as belonging by its very nature to such characters alone.</p> <p>Nor must self-absorbed thoughts be allowed to bound our anticipations of that future. It is no solitary blessedness to which Paul looked forward Alone in his dungeon, alone before his judge when \u2018no man stood by\u2019 him, soon to be alone in his martyrdom, he leaps up in spirit at the thought of the mighty crowd among whom he will stand in that day, on every head a crown, in every heart the same love to the Lord whose life is in them all and makes them all one. So we may cherish the hope of a social heaven. Man\u2019s course begins in a garden, but it ends in a city. The final condition will be the perfection of human society. There all who love Christ will be drawn together, and old ties, broken for a little while here, be reknit in yet holier form, never to be sundered more.</p> <p>Ah, friends, the all-important question for each of us is how may we have such a hope, like a great sunset light shining into the western windows of our souls? There is but one answer - Trust Christ. That is enough. Nothing else is. Is your life built on Jesus Christ? Are you trusting your salvation to Him? Are you giving Him your love and service? Does your life bear looking at to-day? Will it bear looking at in death? Will it bear His looking at in Judgment?  </p> <p>If you can humbly say, To me to live is Christ, then is it well Living by Him we may fight and conquer, may win and obtain.

However, Josiah in fact died tragically in battle against Pharaoh Necho (2 Kgs. 23:29\u201330; 2 Chr. 35:20\u201327). In Jonah 3:4, the prophet (after a submarine detour!) at last arrives at Nineveh to deliver the message the Lord has given him: \u201cForty more days and Nineveh will be overturned.\u201d But it does not happen. The people (and animals; Jonah 3:7) of Nineveh repent in sackcloth, and God changes God\u2019s mind (Jonah 3:10). We might consider as well the many predictions in the New Testament that the end of the world would come soon (e.g., Mark 13:30; 1 Cor. 7:29\u201331; Rev. 22:12, 20), which, taking them at face value, clearly was not the case.The difference between the prophets of the Bible and modern charlatans who confidently claim to see the future is a difference not of degree, but of kind. The prophets are not accurate fortune-tellers, presenting to us their infallible visions of a fixed and unchangeable future. They are not fortune-tellers at all. Rather, the prophets are the obedient messengers of God, passing on to us what God has shown to them. God remains God, sovereign and free, but also caring and responsive to the world that God made and loves (see Jonah 4:1\u20132, 11). So Jeremiah delivers to his people God\u2019s challenge, \u201cIf you really change your ways and your actions\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your forefathers for ever and ever\u201d (Jer. 7:5\u20137). Their present actions will lead them into exile and destruction, but the possibility of a different future lies before them, if they will claim it (though Jeremiah doubts that they can or will; see Jer. 13:23).Similarly, Ezekiel affirms God\u2019s sovereign freedom: \u201cI the LORD bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish\u201d (17:24). God is free to go where God wishes (as the movements of the \u201cglory\u201d in chs. 1\u20133 and 8\u201311 powerfully demonstrate) and to do as God chooses: to punish, or to forgive (18:30\u201332). Hope, for Ezekiel, rests in that sovereign freedom of God\u2014and not in any strength or virtue Israel possesses (16:59\u201363). We find the real difference between Ezekiel and the false prophets of Jerusalem not in the relative accuracy of their predictions, but in where their loyalties lie. The false prophets belong to their masters in the Judean nobility. Ezekiel is first, last, and always, the Lord\u2019s. His appendix regarding Tyre and Egypt does not change that.

No facts are always equally capable of exciting their correspondent emotions. Those which most closely affect our personal life, in which we find our deepest joys, are not always present in our minds, and when they are, do not always touch the springs of our feelings. No possessions are always equally precious to us. The rich man is not always conscious with equal satisfaction of his wealth. If, then, the way from the mind to the emotions is not always equally open, there is a reason why there may be faith without light of joy.

This text, Revelation 20:1-10, provides the chronological structure for the doctrine of the millennium. The prophecies add the content.</p> <p>Revelation 19-22 forms the explicit biblical foundation for the position articulated by contemporary premillennialists. These scholars see in the closing chapters of the Apocalypse a vision of the events of the eschaton arranged in chronological order. Revelation 19:11-16 pictures the return of Christ as the conqueror coming to destroy his enemies. After dealing first with his human political opponent, the triumphant Lord turns his attention to the evil power that lay behind this wicked leader. According to what George Eldon Ladd calls \"the most natural reading\" of Revelation 20:1-10, the destruction of Satan occurs in two stages separated by the millennial era. Christ's cosmic opponent is incarcerated for a thousand years, and then following the final eschatological battle that this archenemy inspires, Satan is banished to the lake of fire.</p> <p>Central to the premillennial position is the interpretation of the two resurrections noted in Revelation 20, which sees both as physical, bodily events. All premillennialists are in agreement that a literalist hermeneutic must be employed in this case, and its use leads to a premillennial eschatology. Ladd offers a concise statement of the underlying principle. \"Unless there is some reason intrinsic within the text itself which requires a symbolical interpretation, or unless there are other Scriptures which interpret a parallel prophecy in a symbolic sense, we are required to employ a natural, literal interpretation.\"</p> <p>On the basis of this principle, premillennial exegetes conclude that the author of Revelation 20 had two bodily resurrections in view. The linchpin of the argument rests on the use of the same Greek word, ezesan (\"they came to life\"), to refer to both resurrections. Does the \"living\" of the righteous souls mentioned in verse 4 refer to a physical resurrection, as in the case with the \"living\" of the \"rest of the dead\" mentioned in verse 5?</p> <p>...</p> <p>But the most significant confirmatory text is 1 Corinthians 15:23-26. Premillennialists see in Paul's words an indication that Christ's triumph over death comes in three stages. The first, Jesus' own resurrection as \"the firstfruits,\" has already occurred (v. 23); two remain future. The resurrection of \"those who belong to him\" occurs \"when he comes\" (v. 23). A millennium later occurs the grant event of the end, \"when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father\" (v. 24). Premillennial apologists claim that the interjection of \"then\" between verses 23 and 24, which separates the apostle's reference to the resurrection of the righteous from his mention of \"the end,\" indicates that Paul anticipated an interregnum of undefined duration between the parousia and the final consummation of history.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/eschatology/#stanleygrenz-millenialmaze_1","title":"stanleygrenz #millenialmaze","text":""},{"location":"Topics/eschatology/#post-millennial-hermeneutic","title":"Post-Millennial Hermeneutic","text":"<p>In defense of a spiritualizing hermeneutic of Old Testament texts, post-millennialists offer a biblically based apologetic. They point out that many prophecies concerning Christ's first coming were not fulfilled literally, but in some spiritualized manner (such as Gen 3:15; Mal 45; Is 40:3-5). In fact, it was their expectations of a literal earthly kingdom and political ruler that caused many Jews to fail to recognize Jesus as their Messiah at his first coming. Further, the New Testament itself finds in events surrounding the infant church the fulfillment to certain Old Testament anticipations concerning Israel's future glory (such as Acts 2:16-21; 15:14- 18). Finally, a literal fulfilment of many prophecies would mean a restoration of Jewish national life in a way that would necessitate a return to the old covenant, which, according to the New Testament, has been replaced by the new covenant within the fellowship of the church. The Old Testament prophets, postmillennialists assert, rightly envisioned a glorious era. But because it was yet future, it could only be intelligently described by employing the thought-forms and the religious and political structures with which people of the day were familiar. They readily utilized the vocabulary of the old economy, which focused on the land of Palestine, the temple and the sacrificial system, and the kingship, to speak of the future messianic era they awaited. The prophets, therefore, could only imagine the future age, in which the whole world would worship Yahweh, in terms of the elevation of Jerusalem as the center of worldwide worship and the establishment of the ideal theocracy in Israel as the political center of the earth. In the light of the New Testament, however, we now know that these prophecies are fulfilled in the glorious victory of the church (for example, Heb 12:18-23). Such a heightened, nonliteral fulfillment is in keeping with the nature of prophecy as understood by postmillennialists. Prophecy is not \"history written beforehand.\" Rather, its primary purpose is, in the words of Boettner, \"to inspire faith in those who see its fulfillment, and only secondarily to inform us of what is going to happen in the future.\"? Although it is different from how many people view prophecy, Boettner's understanding can claim New Testament precedence, Peter' epistle declares that the prophets were not cognizant of the object of their vision of the sufferings and glory of Christ, for they were not serving themselves, but the church (1 Pet 1:10-12). In accordance with postmillennial hermeneutics, Boettner interprets Isaiah 2:2-3, for example, as fulfilled</p> <p>in that the Gospel took its course out from Jerusalem as the disciples went under orders to evangelize all the world, with the Church over the centuries gradually coming into a position of world-wide prominence, gradually increasing in power and becoming more influential in the lives of men throughout the world until it stands out like a mountain on a plane.\"</p> <p>The same hermeneutical approach, however, leads John Jefferson Davis to give the text a yet future referent. To him it speaks of \"the latter day spiritual exaltation of the Christian church,\" at which time the \"pervasive impact of the gospel in the life of the nations produces a state of affairs where warfare and the production of its implements cease.\"89 In either case, postmillennialist exegesis moves from the principle that the church is in some sense the new Israel, \"the true Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem.\" Consequently, the expectations of a glorious future for the nation of Israel envisioned by seers under the old covenant find their fulfillment in the yet future golden age of the church that will culminate the present age of the new covenant (although some postmillennialists also hold out hope for a conversion of Jews in the future),\" For this reason, setting forth on a spiritual plane an interpretation of prophecies that by the necessities of the day were limited to a material horizon, postmillennialists conclude, is the only way to understand correctly the intent of the Bible as a whole, of which these texts are a part. Like Augustine in the fifth century, modern postmillennialists argue that to read out of the visions of the Old Testament a literal, physical and political rule of Christ on the earth after the close of the church age, as premillennialists do, is to fall victim to the old tendency to \"Judaize\" Christianity.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/eschatology/#stanleygrenz-millenialmaze_2","title":"stanleygrenz #millenialmaze","text":""},{"location":"Topics/eschatology/#amillennial-hermeneutic","title":"Amillennial Hermeneutic","text":"<p>The amillennial hermeneutic arises out of a specific understanding of correct biblical interpretation.

Archibald Hughes speaks for all in declaring, \"the New Testament is the foremost and final authority in any enquiry, and it is also the interpreter of the Old Testament.\" The chief implication of this principle is the \"spiritualizing\" of many Old Testament prophecies, for such an approach is in keeping with the New Testament usage of the Old.</p> <p>Floyd Hamilton's description is typical: The literal interpretation of Old Testament prophecy is to accepted, he notes, \"unless (a) the passages contain obviously figurative language, or (b) unless the New Testament gives authority for interpreting them in other than a literal sense, or (c) unless a literal interpretation would produce a contradiction with truths, principles, or factual statements contained in nonsymbolic books of the New Testament.\" Wyngaarden offers two questions for determining that the figurative rather than the literal interpretation is to be employed: Does the Scripture itself spiritualize the prophecy? Or does the prophecy fit in organically with the future of the church?</p> <p>The New Testament offers many examples of the transference of Old Testament expectations for Israel to the church as the new people of God, amillennialists point out. For example, Zion's tent is enlarged (Is 54:1-3) when the Gentiles accept Christ (Gal 4:27); those whom God termed \"not my people\" become \"my people\" (Hos 2:23) through the establishment of the church as the called from both Jew and Gentile (Rom 9:24-26); and the healing waters flow (Ezek 45: compare Is 44:3) through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the church (Jn 7:37-39). Hendricksen explains the principle involved in the nonliteral nature of transferences such as these: \"When a prophecy is destined to be fulfilled in the new dispensation it is fulfilled according to the spirit of that new era. Hence, the Old Testament prophecies are fulfilled in the Spirit-filed church.\"</p> <p>The amillinnenial eschatology is built on a second hermeneutical assertion, namely, that the New Testament as a whole takes precedence over Revelation 20. Again Hamilton articulates the principle: \"The clearest New Testament passages in nonsymbolic books are to be the norm for the interpretation of prophecy... In other words, we should accept the clear and plain parts of Scripture as a basis for getting the true meaning of the more difficult parts of Scripture.\"</p> <p>On the basis of this principle, amillennialists argue that we must understand the vision of the millennium in terms of the simple eschatological chronology they find clearly taught throughout the New Testament (such as 2 Pet 3:10-13). The present age will climax in the return of the Lord in triumph and judgement, followed immediately by the inauguration of the eternal state. Whatever conclusions are gleaned from Revelation 20, therefore, can neither contradict nor supersede but rather must be understood in light of this general New Testament eschatological position.</p> <p>Amillennialists claim that we must understand the mention of a first resurrection prior to the thousand years of Revelation 20:4-5 in a manner that harmonizes with New Testament teaching of the one general resurrection. In fact, amillennialists are convinced that the vision of the seer is but a symbolic restatement of the eschatological expectations presented elsewhere in the New Testament.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/eschatology/#stanleygrenz-millenialmaze_3","title":"stanleygrenz #millenialmaze","text":""},{"location":"Topics/evangelism/","title":"Evangelism","text":""},{"location":"Topics/evangelism/#barnes-on-isaiah-5511","title":"Barnes on Isaiah 55:11","text":"<p>That whatever is his design in giving the gospel, it shall be accomplished.

Looking on all this, He turns to His followers-for it is to the Apostles that the text is spoken, and not to the crowd outside-with this most remarkable exclamation: \u2018O faithless generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?\u2019</p> <p>The first thing that seems to be in the words is not anger, indeed, but a very distinct and very pathetic expression of Christ\u2019s infinite pain, because of man\u2019s faithlessness. The element of personal sorrow is most obvious here. It is not only that He is sad for their sakes that they are so unreceptive, and He can do so little for them-I shall have something to say about that presently-but that He feels for Himself, just as we do in our poor humble measure, the chilling effect of an atmosphere where there is no sympathy. All that ever the teachers and guides and leaders of the world have in this respect had to bear-all the misery of opening out their hearts in the frosty air of unbelief and rejection-Christ endured. All that men have ever felt of how hard it is to keep on working when not a soul understands them, when not a single creature believes in them, when there is no one that will accept their message, none that will give them credit for pure motives-Jesus Christ had to feel, and that in an altogether singular degree. There never was such a lonely soul on this earth as His, just because there never was one so pure and loving. \u2018The little hills rejoice together? as the Psalm says, \u2018on every side,\u2019 but the great Alpine peak is alone there, away up amongst the cold and the snows. Thus lived the solitary Christ, the uncomprehended Christ, the unaccepted Christ. Let us see in this exclamation of His how humanly, and yet how divinely, He felt the loneliness to which His love and purity condemned Him.  </p> <p>The plain felt soul-chilling after the blessed communion of the mountain. There was such a difference between Moses and Elias and the voice that said, \u2018This is My beloved Son: hear Him,\u2019 and the disbelief and slowness of spiritual apprehension of the people down below there, that no wonder that for once the pain that He generally kept absolutely down and silent, broke the bounds even of His restraint, and shaped for itself this pathetic utterance: \u2018How long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?\u2019</p> <p>I know that there are many of the aspects of Christ\u2019s life in which Christ\u2019s griefs tell more on the popular apprehension; but I do not know that there is one in which the title of \u2018The Man of Sorrows\u2019 is to all deeper thinking more pathetically vindicated than in this-the solitude of the uncomprehended and the unaccepted Christ and His pain at His disciples\u2019 faithlessness.</p> <p>We find Him more than once in His life, hemmed in, hindered, baulked of His purpose, thwarted, as I may say, in His design, simply because there was no one with a heart open to receive the rich treasure that He was ready to pour out. He had to keep it locked up in His own spirit, else it would have been wasted and spilled upon the ground. \u2018He could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief\u2019; and here He is standing in the midst of the men that knew Him best, that understood Him most, that were nearest to Him in sympathy; but even they were not ready for all this wealth of affection, all this infinitude of blessing, with which His heart is charged. They offered no place to put it. They shut up the narrow cranny through which it might have come, and so He has to turn from them, bearing it away unbestowed, like some man who goes out in the morning with his seed-basket full, and finds the whole field where he would fain have sown covered already with springing weeds or encumbered with hard rock, and has to bring back the germs of possible life to bless and fertilise some other soil. \u2018He that goeth forth weeping, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with joy\u2019; but He that comes back weeping, bearing the precious seed that He found no field to sow in, knows a deeper sadness, which has in it no prophecy of joy. It is wonderfully pathetic and beautiful, I think, to see how Jesus Christ knew the pains of wounded love that cannot get expressed because there is not heart to receive it.</p> <p>It was to disciples that He said, \u2018O faithless generation!\u2019 He did not mean to charge them with the entire absence of all confidence, but He did mean to declare that their poor, feeble faith, such as it was, was not worth naming in comparison with the abounding mass of their unbelief. There was one spark of light in them, and there was also a great heap of green wood that had not caught the flame and only smoked instead of blazing. And so He said to them, \u2018O faithless generation!\u2019</p> <p>The version of that clause in Matthew and Luke adds a significant word,-\u2019faithless and perverse generation.\u2019 The addition carries a grave lesson, as teaching us that the two characteristics are inseparably united; that the want of faith is morally a crime and sin; that unbelief is at once the most tragic manifestation of man\u2019s perverse will, and also in its turn the source of still more obstinate and wide-spreading evil. Blindness to His light and rejection of His love, He treats as the very head and crown of sin. Like intertwining snakes, the loathly heads are separate; but the slimy convolutions are twisted indistinguishably together, and all unbelief has in it the nature of perversity, as all perversity has in it the nature of unbelief. \u2018He will convince the world of sin, because they believe not on Me.\u2019</p> <p>Do not we know that the purer our love, and the more it has purified us, the more sensitive it becomes, even while the less suspicious it becomes? Is not the purest, most unselfish, highest love, that by which the least failure in response is felt most painfully? Though there be no anger, and no change in the love, still there is a pang where there is an inadequate perception, or an unworthy reception, of it. And Scripture seems to countenance the belief that Divine Love, too, may know something, in some mysterious fashion, like that feeling, when it warns us, \u2018Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.\u2019 So we may venture to say, Grieve not the Christ of God, who redeems us; and remember that we grieve Him most when we will not let Him pour His love upon us, but turn a sullen, unresponsive unbelief towards His pleading grace, as some glacier shuts out the sunshine from the mountain-side with its thick-ribbed ice.</p> <p>As there is not anger, but only pain, so there is also, I think, not exactly impatience, but a desire to depart, coupled with the feeling that He cannot leave them till they have grown stronger in faith. And that feeling is increased by the experience of their utter helplessness and shameful discomfiture during His brief absence They had shown that they were not fit to be trusted alone. He had been away for a day up in the mountain there, and though they did not build an altar to any golden calf, like their ancestors, when their leader was absent, still when He comes back He finds things all gone wrong because of the few hours of His absence. What would they do if He were to go away from them altogether? They would never be able to stand it at all. It is impossible that He should leave them thus-raw, immature. The plant has not yet grown sufficiently strong to take away the prop round which it climbed. \u2018How long must I be with you?\u2019 says the loving Teacher, who is prepared ungrudgingly to give His slow scholars as much time as they need to learn their lesson. He is not impatient, but He desires to finish the task; and yet He is ready to let the scholars\u2019 dulness determine the duration of His stay. Surely that is wondrous and heart-touching love, that Christ should let their slowness measure the time during which He should linger here, and refrain from the glory which He desired. We do not know all the reasons which determined the length of our Lord\u2019s life upon earth, but this was one of them,-that He could not go away until He had left these men strong enough to stand by themselves, and to lay the foundations of the Church. Therefore He yielded to the plea of their very faithlessness and backwardness, and with this wonderful word of condescension and appeal bade them say for how many more days He must abide in the plain, and turn His back on the glories that had gleamed for a moment on the mountain of transfiguration.</p> <p>There is rebuke in His question, but how tender a rebuke it is! He rebukes without anger. He names the fault plainly. He shows distinctly His sorrow, and does not hide the strain on His forbearance. That is His way of cure for His servants\u2019 faithlessness. It was His way on earth; it is His way in heaven. To us, too, comes the loving rebuke of this question, \u2018How long shall I suffer you?\u2019  </p> <p>Thank God that our answer may be cast into the words of His own promise: \u2018I say not unto thee, until seven times; but until seventy times seven.\u2019 \u2018Bear with me till Thou hast perfected me; and then bear me to Thyself, that I may be with Thee for ever, and grieve Thy love no more.\u2019 So may it be, for \u2018with Him is plenteous redemption,\u2019 and His forbearing \u2018mercy endureth for ever.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"Topics/faith/#spurgeon","title":"Spurgeon","text":"<p>You believe it, you say.

No wolf prays for its offspring to become a sheep. The ungodly man sets small store by the godliness of his children, since he thinks nothing of it for himself. He who does not value his own soul is not likely to value the souls of his descendants. He who rejects Christ on his own account is not likely to be enamored of Him on his children\u2019s behalf. Abraham prayed for Ishmael, but I never read that Ishmael prayed for his son Nebajoth. I fear that many, even among professors of religion, could not truthfully repeat my text, they look for other joy in their children and care little whether they are walking in the truth or not. They joy in them if they are healthy in body, but they are not saddened if the leprosy of sin remains upon them. They joy in their comely looks but do not inquire whether they have found favor in the sight of the Lord. Put the girl\u2019s feet in silver slippers, and many heads of families would never raise the question as to whether she walked the broad or the narrow road. It is very grievous to see how some professedly Christian parents are satisfied so long as their children display cleverness in learning, or sharpness in business, although they show no signs of a renewed nature. If they pass their examinations with credit, and promise to be well-fitted for the world\u2019s battle, their parents forget that there is a superior calling, involving a higher crown, for which the child will need to be fitted by divine grace and armed with the whole armor of God. Alas, if our children lose the crown of life, it will be but a small consolation that they have won the laurels of literature or art. Many who ought to know better think themselves superlatively blessed in their children if they become rich, if they marry well, if they strike out into profitable enterprises in trade, or if they attain eminence in the profession which they have espoused. Their parents will go to their beds rejoicing and awake perfectly satisfied, though their boys are hastening down to hell, if they are also making money by the bushel. They have no greater joy than that their children are having their portion in this life and laying up treasure where rust corrupts it. Though neither their sons nor daughters show any signs of the new birth; give no evidence of being rich towards God, manifest no traces of electing love or redeeming grace, or the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit, yet there are parents who are content with their condition. Now I can only say of such professing parents that they have need to question whether they are Christians at all. And if they will not question it themselves, they must give some of us leave to hold it in serious debate. When a man\u2019s heart is really right with God and he himself, has been saved from the wrath to come and is living in the light of his heavenly Father\u2019s countenance, it is certain that he is anxious about his children\u2019s souls, prizes their immortal natures and feels that nothing could give him greater joy than to hear that his children walk in the truth. Judge yourselves, then, beloved, this morning, by the gentle but searching test of the text. If you are professing Christians, but cannot say that you have no greater joy than the conversion of your children, you have reason to question whether you ought to have made such a profession at all.</p> <p>I will tell you why this is peculiarly the great joy of some Christian parents\u2014it is because they have made it a subject of persistent prayer. That which comes to us by the gate of prayer comes into the house with music and rallying. If you have asked for it with tears, you will receive it with smiles. The joy of an answer to prayer is very much in proportion to the wrestling which went with the prayer. If you have felt, sometimes, as though your heart could break for your offspring unless they were soon converted to God, then, I will tell you, when they are converted you will feel as though your heart would break the other way out of joy to think that they have been saved. Your eyes, which have been red with weeping over their youthful follies, will one day become bright with rejoicing over holy actions which will mark the work of the grace of God in their hearts. No wonder that Hannah sang so sweetly, for she had prayed so earnestly. The Lord had heard her and the joy of the answer was increased by the former anguish of her prayer. We have no greater joy than this that our children walk in the truth. And it is a right and allowable joy.

Only, in his usual fashion, he turns the antithesis into a somewhat different form, so as to suggest another aspect of the truth, and instead of saying, as we might expect for the verbal accuracy of the contrast, \u2018If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with God,\u2019 he says, \u2018we have fellowship one with another.\u2019 Then he adds a still further result of that walk, \u2018the blood of Jesus cleanses from all sin.\u2019</p> <p>That just comes to this, that the only cement that perfectly knits men to each other is their common possession of that light, and the consequent fellowship with God. There are plenty of other bonds that draw us to one another; but these, if they are not strengthened by this deepest of all bonds, the affinity of souls, that are moving together in the realm of light and purity, are precarious, and apt to snap. Sin separates men quite as much as it separates each man from God.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/family/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"Topics/godliness/","title":"Godliness","text":""},{"location":"Topics/godliness/#martin-lloyd-jones-notetaker","title":"Martin Lloyd-Jones notetaker","text":"<p>We must not give a ready-made Christian position.

The Psalmist\u2019s longings are expressed in the first of them in plain words, and in the second in a figure. \u2018To do God\u2019s will\u2019 is to be in \u2018the land of uprightness.\u2019 That phrase, in its literal application, means a stretch of level country, and hence is naturally employed as an emblem of a moral or religious condition. A life of obedience to the will of God is likened to some far stretching plain, easy to traverse, broken by no barren mountains or frowning cliffs, but basking, peaceful and fruitful, beneath the smile of God. Into such a garden of the Lord the Psalmist prays to be led.  </p> <p>In each case his prayer is based upon a motive or plea. \u2018Thou art my God\u2019; his faith apprehends a personal bond between him and God, and feels that that bond obliges God to teach him His will. If we adopt the reading in our Bibles of our second clause a still deeper and more wonderful plea is presented there. \u2018Thy Spirit is good,\u2019 and therefore the trusting spirit has a right to ask to be made good likewise. The relation of the believing spirit to God not only obliges God to teach it His will, but to make it partaker of His own image and conformed to His own purity. So high on wings of faith and desire soared this man, who, at the beginning of his psalm, was crushed to the dust by enemies and by dangers. So high we may rise by like means.  </p> <p>I. Notice, then, first, the supreme desire of the devout soul. </p> <p>We do not know who wrote this psalm. The superscription says that it was David\u2019s, and although its place in the Psalter seems to suggest another author, the peculiar fervour and closeness of intimacy with God which breathes through it are like the Davidic psalms, and seem to confirm the superscription. If so, it will naturally fall into its place with the others which were pressed from his heart by the rebellion of Absalom. But be that as it may, whosoever wrote the psalm, was a man in extremest misery and peril, and as he says of himself, \u2018persecuted,\u2019 \u2018overwhelmed,\u2019 \u2018desolate.\u2019 The tempest blows him to the Throne of God, and when he is there, what does he ask? Deliverance? Scarcely. In one clause, and again at the end, as if by a kind of after-thought, he asks for the removal of the calamities. But the main burden of his prayer is for a closer knowledge of God, the sound of His lovingkindness in his inward ear, light to show him the way wherein he should walk, and the sweet sunshine of God\u2019s face upon his heart. There is a better thing to ask than exemption from sorrows, even grace to bear them rightly. The supreme desire of the devout soul is practical conformity to the will of God. For the prayer of our text is not \u2018Teach me to know Thy will.\u2019 The Psalmist, indeed, has asked that in a previous clause-\u2019Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk.\u2019 But knowledge is not all that we need, and the gulf between knowledge and practice is so deep that after we have prayed that we may be caused to know the way, and have received the answer, there still remains the need for God\u2019s help that knowledge may become life, and that all which we understand we may do. To such practical conformity to the will of God all other aspects of religion are meant to be subservient.  </p> <p>Christianity is a revelation of truth, but to accept it as such is not enough. Christianity brings to me exemption from punishment, escape from hell, deliverance from condemnation and guilt, and by some of us, that is apt to be regarded as the whole Gospel; but pardon is only a means to an end. Christianity brings to us the possibility of indulgence in sweet and blessed emotions, and a fervour of feeling which to experience is the ante-past of heaven, and for some of us, all our religion goes off in vaporous emotion; but feeling alone is not Christianity. Our religion brings to us sweet and gracious consolations, but it is a poor affair if we only use it as an anodyne and a comfort. Our Christianity brings to us glorious hopes that flash lustre into the darkness, and make the solitude of the grave companionship, and the end of earth the beginning of life, but it is a poor affair if the mightiest operation of our religion be relegated to a future, and flung on to the close. All these things, the truth which the Gospel brings, the pardon and peace of conscience which it ensures, the joyful emotion which it sets loose from the ice of indifference, the sweet consolations with which it pillows the weary head and bandages the bleeding heart, and the great hopes which flash light into glazing eyes, and make the end glorious with the rays of a beginning, and the western heaven bright with the promise of a new day-all these things are but subservient means to this highest purpose, that we should do the will of God, and be conformed to His image. They whose religion has not reached that apex have yet to understand its highest meaning. The river of the water of life that proceeds from the Throne of God and the Lamb is not sent merely to refresh thirsty lips, and to bring music into the silence of a waterless desert, but it is sent to drive the wheels of life. Action, not thought, is the end of God\u2019s revelation, and the perfecting of man.</p> <p>But, then, let us remember that we shall most imperfectly apprehend the whole sweep and blessedness of this great supreme aim of the devout soul, if we regard this doing of God\u2019s will as merely the external act of obedience to an external command. Simple doing is not enough; the deed must be the fruit of love. The aim of the Christian life is not obedience to a law that is recognised as authoritative, but joyful moulding of ourselves after a law that is felt to be sweet and loving. \u2018I delight to do Thy will, yea! Thy law is within my heart.\u2019 Only when thus the will yields itself in loving and glad conformity to the will of God is true obedience possible for us. Brother! is that your Christianity? Do you desire, more than anything besides, that what He wills you should will, and that His law should be stamped upon your hearts, and all your rebellious desires and purposes should be brought into a sweet captivity which is freedom, and an obedience to Christ which is kingship over the universe and yourselves?  </p> <p>II. Note, secondly, the divine teaching and touch which are required for this conformity. </p> <p>The Psalmist betakes himself to prayer, because he knows that of himself he cannot bring his will into this attitude of harmonious submission. And his prayer for \u2018teaching\u2019 is deepened in the second clause of our text into a petition, which is substantially the same in meaning, but yet sets the felt need and the coveted help in a still more striking light, in its cry for the touch of God\u2019s good spirit to guide, as by a hand grasping the Psalmist\u2019s hand, into the paths of obedience.  </p> <p>We may learn from this prayer, then, that practical conformity to God\u2019s will can never be attained by our own efforts. Remember all the hindrances that rise between us and it; these wild passions of ours, this obstinate gravitating of tastes and desires towards earth, these animal necessities, these spiritual perversities, which make up so much of us all-how can we coerce these into submission? Our better selves sit within like some prisoned king, surrounded and \u2018fooled by the rebel powers\u2019 of his revolted subjects; and our best recourse is to send an embassy to the Over-lord, the Sovereign King, praying Him to come to our help. We cannot will to will as God wills, but we can turn ourselves to Him, and ask Him to put the power within us which shall subdue the evil, conquer the rebels, and make us masters of our own else anarchic and troubled spirits. For all honest attempts to make the will of God our wills, the one secret of success is confident and continual appeal to Him. A man must have gone a very little way, very superficially and perfunctorily, on the path of seeking to make himself what he ought to be, unless he has found out that he cannot do it, and unless he has found out that there is only one way to do it, and that is to go to God and say, \u2018O Lord! I am baffled and beaten. I put the reins into Thy hand; do Thou inspire and direct and sanctify.\u2019  </p> <p>That practical conformity to the will of God requires divine teaching, but yet that teaching must be no outward thing. It is not enough that we should have communicated to us, as from without, the clearest knowledge of what we ought to be. There must be more than that. Our Psalmist\u2019s prayer was a prophecy. He said, \u2018Teach me to do Thy will.\u2019 And he thought, no doubt, of an inward teaching which should mould his nature as well as enlighten it; of the communication of impulses as well as of conceptions; of something which should make him love the divine will, as well as of something which should make him know it.  </p> <p>You and I have Jesus Christ for our Teacher, the answer to the psalm. His teaching is inward and deep and real, and answers to all the necessities of the case. We have His example to stand as our perfect law. If we want to know what is God\u2019s will, we have only to turn to that life; and however different from ours His may have been in its outward circumstances, and however fragmentary and brief its records in the Gospels may sometimes seem to us, yet in these little booklets, telling of the quiet life of the carpenter\u2019s Son, there is guidance for every man and woman in all circumstances, however complicated, and we do not need anything more to teach us what God\u2019s will is than the life of Jesus Christ. His teaching goes deeper than example. He comes into our hearts, He moulds our wills. His teaching is by inward impulses and communications of desire and power to do, as well as of light to know. A law has been given which can give life. As the modeller will take a piece of wax into his hand, and by warmth and manipulation make it soft and pliable, so Jesus Christ, if we let Him, will take our hard hearts into His hands, and by gentle, loving, subtle touches, will shape them into the pattern of His own perfect beauty, and will mould all their vagrant inclinations and aberrant distortions into \u2018one immortal feature of loveliness and perfection.\u2019 \u2018The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men teaching that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,\u2019 controlling ourselves, \u2018righteously,\u2019 fulfilling all our obligations to our fellows, \u2018and godly,\u2019 referring everything to Him, \u2018in this present world.\u2019  </p> <p>That practical conformity to the divine will requires, still further, the operation of the divine Spirit as our Guide. \u2018Thy Spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness.\u2019 There is only one power that can draw us out of the far-off land of rebellious disobedience, where the prodigals and the swine\u2019s husks and the famine and the rags are, into the \u2018land of uprightness,\u2019 and that is, the communicated Spirit of God, which is given to all them that desire Him, and will lead them in paths of righteousness for His name\u2019s sake. It is He that works in us, the willing and the doing, according to His own good pleasure. \u2018He shall guide you,\u2019 said the Master, \u2018into all truth\u2019-not merely into its knowledge, but into its performance, not merely into truth of conception, but into truth of practice, which is righteousness, and the fulfilling of the Law.  </p> <p>III. Lastly, note the divine guarantee that this practical conformity shall be ours. </p> <p>The Psalmist pleads with God a double motive-His relation to us and His own perfectness, \u2018Thou art my God; therefore teach me.\u2019 \u2018Thy Spirit is good; therefore lead me into the land of uprightness.\u2019 I can but glance for a moment at these two pleas of the prayer.  </p> <p>Note, then, first, God\u2019s personal relation to the devout soul, as the guarantee that that soul shall be taught, not merely to know, but also to do His will. If He be \u2018my God,\u2019 there can be no deeper desire in His heart, than that His will should be my will. And this He desires, not from any masterfulness or love of dominion, but only from love to us. If He be my God, and therefore longing to have me obedient, He will not withhold what is needed to make me so. God is no hard Taskmaster who sets us to make bricks without straw. Whatsoever He commands He gives, and His commandments are always second and His gifts first. He bestows Himself and then He says, \u2018For the love\u2019s sake, do My will.\u2019 Be sure that the sacred bond which knits us to Him is regarded by Him, the faithful Creator, as an obligation which He recognises and respects and will discharge. We have a right to go to Him and to say to Him, \u2018Thou art my God; and Thou wilt not be what Thou art, nor do what Thou hast pledged Thyself to do, unless Thou makest me to know and to do Thy will.\u2019  </p> <p>And on the other hand, if we have taken Him for ours, and have the bond knit from our side as well as from His, then the fact of our faith gives us a claim on Him which He is sure to honour. The soul that can say, \u2018I have taken Thee for mine,\u2019 has a hold on God which God is only too glad to recognise and to vindicate. And whoever, humbly trusting to that great Father in the heavens, feels that he belongs to God, and that God belongs to him, is warranted in praying, \u2018Teach me, and make me, to do Thy will,\u2019 and in being confident of an answer.  </p> <p>And there is the other plea with Him and guarantee for us, drawn from God\u2019s own moral character and perfectness. The last clause of my text may either be read as our Bible has it, \u2018Thy Spirit is good; lead me,\u2019 or \u2018Let Thy good Spirit lead me.\u2019 In either case the goodness of the divine Spirit is the plea on which the prayer is grounded. The goodness here referred to is, as I take it, not merely beneficence and kindliness, but rather goodness in its broader and loftier sense of perfect moral purity. **So that the thought just comes to this-we have the right to expect that we shall be made participant of the divine nature for so sweet, so deep, so tender is the tie that knits a devout soul to God, that nothing short of conformity to the perfect purity of God can satisfy the aspirations of the creature, or discharge the obligations of the Creator. **</p> <p>It is a daring thought. The Psalmist\u2019s desire was a prophecy. The New Testament vindicates and fulfils it when it says \u2018We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\u2019 Since He now dwells in \u2018the land of uprightness,\u2019 who once dwelt among us in this weary world of confusion and of sin, then we one day shall be with Him. Christ\u2019s heart cannot be satisfied, Christ\u2019s Cross cannot be rewarded, the divine nature cannot be at rest, the purpose of redemption cannot be accomplished, until all who have trusted in Christ be partakers of divine purity, and all the wanderers be led by devious and yet by right paths, by crooked and yet by straight ways, by places rough and yet smooth, into \u2018the land of uprightness.\u2019 Where and what He is, there and that shall also His servants be. </p> <p>My brother! if to do the will of God is to dwell in the land of uprightness, disobedience is to dwell in a dry and thirsty land, barren and dreary, horrid with frowning rocks and jagged cliffs, where every stone cuts the feet and every step is a blunder, and all the paths end at last on the edge of an abyss, and crumble into nothingness beneath the despairing foot that treads them. Do you see to it that you walk in ways of righteousness which are paths of peace; and look for all the help you need, with assured faith, to Him who shall \u2018guide us by His counsel and afterwards receive us to His glory.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"Topics/growth/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"Topics/heresy/","title":"Heresy and False Teaching","text":""},{"location":"Topics/heresy/#criag-keener-on-2-timothy-36","title":"Criag Keener on 2 Timothy 3:6","text":"<p>Because women were usually less educated, they were more susceptible than men to false teaching (see comment on 1 Tim 2:11-12). Women\u2019s penchant for switching religions was ridiculed by satirists like *Juvenal and offended conservative Romans. Women reportedly converted to Christianity, Judaism, and the cults of Isis, Serapis and other deities far more readily than men; and in the second century a.d. women were attracted to many heretical movements. Because they were less educated in traditional religion and had less social standing to lose, they more quickly changed religiously, sometimes for good and sometimes for bad. (With regard to Judaism, they also lacked the male disincentive of the pain of male circumcision.) The false teachers had to get into the homes because they had less access to the women in public (due to married women\u2019s partial segregation in Greek society). After they had gained access to a household, their male or female convert within the household could supply financial and other help to them.

There may be much that is beautiful and elevating and noble without these; but unless in some measure we pass through the prophet\u2019s experience, we shall fail to reach the highest possibilities of beauty and of service that open before us. So I wish to consider, very simply, these three stages in my remarks now.</p> <p>I. If we see God we shall see our sin.</p> <p>It was not joy that sprang in Isaiah\u2019s heart when he saw the throned King, and heard the proclamation of His name. It was not reverence merely that bowed his head in the dust, but it was the awakened consciousness, \u2018Thou art holy; and now that I understand, in some measure, what Thy holiness means, I look on myself and I say, \u201cunclean! unclean!\u201d\u2018</p> <p>But it was not only the consciousness of sinfulness and antagonism that woke up instantaneously in response to that vision of the holy God. It was likewise a shrinking apprehension of personal evil from contact of God\u2019s light with Isaiah\u2019s darkness. \u2018Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart.\u2019 What is to become, then, of the man that has neither the one nor the other?</p> <p>II. Again, note the second stage here, in the education of a soul for service-the sin, recognised and repented, is burned away.</p> <p>Which being translated is just this: faith alone will not bring cleansing. There must go with it what we call, in our Christian phraseology, repentance, which is but the recognition of my own antagonism to the holiness of God, and the resolve to turn my back on my own past self. Now, it seems to me that a great deal of what is called, and in a sense is, Evangelical teaching, fails to represent the full counsel of God, in the matter of man\u2019s redemption, because it puts a one-sided emphasis on faith, and slurs over the accompanying idea of repentance. And I am here to say that a trust in Jesus Christ, which is unaccompanied by a profound penitent consciousness and abhorrence of one\u2019s own sins, and a resolve to turn away from them for the time to come, is not a faith which will bring either pardon or cleansing. We do not need to have less said about trust; we need to have a great deal more said about repentance. You have to learn what it is to say, \u2018I abhor myself\u2019; you have to learn what it is to say, \u2018I will turn right round, and leave all that past behind me; and go in the opposite direction\u2019; or the faith which you say you are exercising will neither save nor cleanse your souls nor your lives.</p> <p>To confess is to be forgiven, and the moment that the consciousness of sin rises in the heart, that moment does the heavenly messenger come to still and soothe.</p> <p>Now, let us remember that we have the fulness of all that was shadowed to the prophet in this vision, and that the reality of every one of these emblems is gathered together-if I may so say-not with confusion, but with abundance and opulence in Jesus Christ Himself. Is He not the seraph? Is He not Himself the burning coal? Is He not the altar from which it is taken? All that is needed to make the foulest clean is given in Christ\u2019s great work. Brethren, we shall never understand the deepest secret of Christ and of Christianity until we learn and hold fast by the conviction that the central work of Jesus is to deal with man\u2019s sin; and that whatever else Christianity is, it is first and foremost God\u2019s way of redeeming the world, and making it possible for the unholy to dwell with His holy self.</p> <p>III. Lastly, and only a word, the third stage here is-the purged spirit is ready for service.</p> <p>God did not bid the prophet go on His mission till the prophet had voluntarily accepted the mission. He said, \u2018Who will go for us?\u2019 He wants no pressed men in His army. He does not work with reluctant servants. There is, first, the yielding of the will, and then there is the enduement with the privilege of service. The prophet, having passed through the preceding experiences, had thereby received a quick ear to hear God\u2019s calling for volunteers. And we shall not hear Him asking \u2018Who will go?\u2019 unless we have, in our measure, passed through similar experiences. It will be a test of having done so, of our having been purged from our evil, if, when other people think that it is only Eli speaking, we know that it is the Lord that has called us, and say, \u2018Here am I.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"Topics/holiness/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"Topics/hope/","title":"Hope &amp; Disappointments","text":""},{"location":"Topics/hope/#barnes-on-psalm-425","title":"Barnes on Psalm 42:5","text":"<p>Why art thou cast down, O my soul? - Margin, bowed down. The Hebrew word means to bow down, to incline oneself; then, usually, to prostrate oneself as in public worship; and then, to sink down under the weight of sorrow; to be depressed and sad. The Septuagint renders it, \"Why art thou grieved?\" - \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 perilupos. So the Vulgate. This is an earnest remonstrance addressed by himself to his own soul, as if there were really no occasion for this excessive depression; as if he cherished his grief improperly. There was a brighter side, and he ought to turn to that, and take a more cheerful view of the matter. He had allowed his mind to rest on the dark side, to look at the discouraging things in his condition. He now felt that this was in some measure voluntary, or had been indulged too freely, and that it was wrong: that it was proper for a man like him to seek for comfort in brighter views; that it was a duty which he owed to himself and to the cause of religion to take brighter views. We may remark,</p> <p>(1) That there are two sides to the events which occur, and which seem so discouraging to us - a dark side and a bright side.</p> <p>(2) That in certain states of mind, connected often with a diseased nervous system, we are prone to look only on the dark side, to see only what is gloomy and discouraging.</p> <p>(3) That this often becomes in a sense voluntary, and that we find a melancholy satisfaction in being miserable, and in making ourselves more unhappy, as if we had been wronged, and as if there were a kind of virtue in dejection and gloom - in \"refusing,\" like Rachel, \"to be comforted\" Jeremiah 31:15; perhaps also feeling as if by this we were deserving of the divine approbation, and laying the foundation for some claim to favor on the score of merit.</p> <p>(4) That in this we are often eminently guilty, as putting away those consolations which God has provided for us; as if a man, under the influence of some morbid feeling, should find a kind of melancholy pleasure in starving himself to death in the midst of a garden full of fruit, or dying of thirst by, the side of a running fountain. And</p> <p>(5) That it is the duty of the people of God to look at the bright side of things; to think of the past mercies of God; to survey the blessings which surround us still; to look to the future, in this world and the next, with hope; and to come to God, and cast the burden on him. It is a part of religious duty to be cheer ful; and a man may often do more real good by a cheerful and submissive mind in times of affliction, than he could by much active effort in the days of health, plenty, and prosperity. Every sad and desponding Christian ought to say to his soul, \"Why art thou thus cast down?\"</p> <p>And why art thou disquieted in me? - Troubled, sad. The word means literally,</p> <p>(1) to growl as a bear;</p> <p>(2) to sound, or make a noise, as a harp, rain, waves;</p> <p>(3) to be agitated, troubled, or anxious in mind: to moan internally. See the notes at Isaiah 16:11; compare Jeremiah 48:36.</p> <p>Hope thou in God - That is, trust in him, with the hope that he will interpose and restore thee to the privileges and comforts heretofore enjoyed. The soul turns to God when all other hope fails, and finds comfort in the belief that he can and will aid us.</p> <p>For I shall yet praise him - Margin, give thanks. The idea is, that he would yet have occasion to give him thanks for his merciful interposition. This implies a strong assurance that these troubles would not last always.</p> <p>For the help of his countenance - literally, \"the salvations of his face,\" or his presence. The original word rendered help is in the plural number, meaning salvations; and the idea in the use of the plural is, that his deliverance would be completed or entire - as if double or manifold. The meaning of the phrase \"help of his countenance\" or \"face,\" is that God would look favorably or benignly upon him. Favor is expressed in the Scriptures by lifting up the light of the countenance on one. See the notes at Psalm 4:6; compare Psalm 11:7; Psalm 21:6; Psalm 44:3; Psalm 89:15. This closes the first part of the psalm, expressing the confident belief of the psalmist that God would yet interpose, and that his troubles would have an end; reposing entire confidence in God as the only ground of hope; and expressing the feeling that when that confidence exists the soul should not be dejected or cast down.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/hope/#barnes","title":"barnes","text":""},{"location":"Topics/hope/#barnes-on-psalm-1435","title":"Barnes on Psalm 143:5","text":"<p>I remember the days of old - Former times.</p> <p>(1) as contrasted with my present condition.</p> <p>(2) as times when I called upon thee, and thou didst interpose.</p> <p>(3) as encouraging me now to come to thee, and spread out my case before thee.

Here David cries out to God, protesting his innocence and challenging the fairness of the way he is being treated. \ud83d\udd25For us, like David and Jeremiah, one of the best ways to work through our discouragement is to pour out our hearts to God while we remember his faithfulness in the past.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/lament/#jdanielhays-teachthetext","title":"jdanielhays #teachthetext","text":""},{"location":"Topics/lament/#on","title":"on","text":""},{"location":"Topics/lament/#on_1","title":"on","text":""},{"location":"Topics/law/","title":"Law","text":""},{"location":"Topics/law/#maclaren-on-psalm-119165","title":"MacLaren on Psalm 119:165","text":"<p>We do great injustice to this psalm-so exuberant in its praises of \u2018the law of the Lord\u2019-if we suppose that that expression means nothing more than the Mosaic or Jewish revelation. It does mean that, of course, but the psalm itself shows that the writer uses the expression and its various synonyms as including a great deal more than any one method by which God\u2019s will is made known to man. For he speaks, for instance, in one part of the psalm of God\u2019s \u2018word,\u2019 as being settled for ever in the heavens, and of the heavens and earth as continuing to this day, \u2018according to Thine ordinances.\u2019  </p> <p>So we are warranted in giving to the thought of our text the wider extension of taking the divine \u2018law\u2019 to include not only that directory of conduct contained in Scripture, but the expressed will of God, involving duties for us, in whatever way it is made known. The love of that uttered will, the Psalmist declares, will always bring peace. Such an understanding of the text does not exclude the narrower reference, which is often taken to be the only thought in the Psalmist\u2019s mind, nor does it obliterate the distinction between the written law of God and the disclosures of His will which we collect by the exercise of our faculties on events around and facts within us. But it widens the horizon of our contemplations, and bases the promised peace on its true foundation, the submission of the human to the divine will.  </p> <p>Let us then consider how true love to the will of God, however it is made known to us, either in the Book or in our consciousness, or in daily providences, or by other people\u2019s hints, is the talisman that brings to us, in all circumstances, and in every part of our nature, a tranquillity which nothing can disturb.  </p> <p>Of course, by \u2018love\u2019 here is meant, not only delight in the expression of, but the submission of the whole being to, God\u2019s will; and we love the law only when, and because, we love the Lawgiver.  </p> <p>***I. Thus loving the law of God, not only with delight in the vehicle of its expression, but with inward submission to its behests, we shall have, first of all, the peacefulness of a restful heart.  ***</p> <p>Such a heart has found an adequate and worthy object for the outgoings of its affections. Base things loved always disturb. Noble things loved always tranquillise. And he to whom his judgment declares that the best of all things is God\u2019s manifested will, and whose affections and emotions and actions follow the dictate of his judgment, has a love which grasps whatsoever things are noble and fair and of good report, and is lifted to a level corresponding with the loftiness of its objects. For our hearts are like the creatures in some river, of which they tell us that they change their colour according to the hue of the bed of the stream in which they float and of the food of which they partake. The heart that lives on the will of God will be calm and steadfast, and ennobled into reposeful tranquillity like that which it grasps and grapples.  </p> <p>Little boats which are made fast to the sides of a ship rise and fall with the tide, as does that to which they are attached. And our hearts, if they be roped to the fleeting, the visible, the creatural, the finite, partake of the fluctuations, and finally are involved in the destruction, of that which they have made their supreme good. And contrariwise, they who love that which is eternal shine with a light thrown by reflection from the object of their love, and \u2018he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever,\u2019 like the will which he doeth. \u2018Great peace\u2019-the peace of a restful heart-\u2019have they that love Thy law.\u2019  </p> <p>***II. Then again, such love brings the calm of a submitted will. ***</p> <p>Brethren! it is not sorrow that troubles us so much as resistance to sorrow. It is not pain that lacerates; it cuts, and cuts clean when we keep ourselves still and let it do its merciful ministry upon us. But it is the plunging and struggling under the knife that makes the wounds jagged and hard to heal. The man who bows his will to the Supreme, in quiet acceptance of that which He sends, is never disturbed. Resistance distracts and agitates; acquiescence brings a great calm. Submission is peace. **And when we have learned to bend our wills, and let God break them, if that be His will, in order to bend them, then \u2018nothing shall by any means hurt us\u2019; and nothing shall by any means trouble us.  **</p> <p>If you were ever on board a sailing-ship you know the difference between its motion when it is beating up against the wind and when it is running before it. In the one case all is agitation and uneasiness, in the other all is smooth and frictionless and delicious. So, when we go with the great stream, in not ignoble surrender, then we go quietly. It is God\u2019s great intention, in all that befalls us in this life, to bring our wills into conformity with His. Blessed is the ministry of sorrow and of pain and of loss, if it does that for us, and disastrous and accursed is the ministry of joy and success if it does not. There is no joy but calm, and there is no calm but in-not the annihilation, but-the intensest activity of will, in the act of submitting to that higher will, which is discerned to be \u2018good,\u2019 and is gratefully taken as \u2018acceptable,\u2019 and will one day be seen to have been \u2018perfect.\u2019 **The joy and peace of a submitted will are the secret of all true tranquillity.  **</p> <p>***III. Then again, there comes by such a love the peace of an obedient life. ***</p> <p>When once we have taken it {and faithfully adhere to the choice} as our supreme desire to do God\u2019s will, we are delivered from almost all the things that distract and disturb us. Away go all the storms of passion, and we are no more at the mercy of vagrant inclinations. We are no longer agitated by having to consult our own desires, and seeking to find in them compass and guide for our lives-a hopeless attempt! All these sources of agitation are dried up, and the man who has only this desire, to do his duty because God has made it such, has an ever powerful charm, which makes him tranquil whatever befalls.  </p> <p>And as thus we may be delivered from all the agitations and cross-currents of conflicting wishes, inclinations, aims, which otherwise would make a jumble and a chaos of our lives, so, on the other hand, if for us the supreme desire is to obey God, then we are delivered from the other great enemy to tranquillity-namely, anxious forecasting of possible consequences of our actions, which robs so many of us of so many quiet days. \u2018I do the little I can do,\u2019 said Faber, \u2018and leave the rest with Thee,\u2019 and that will bring peace. Instead of wondering what is to come of this step and that, whether our plans will turn out as we hope, and so being at the mercy of contingencies impossible to be forecasted, we cast all upon Him and say, \u2018I have nothing to do with the far end of my actions. Thou givest them a body as it has pleased Thee. I have to do with this end of my actions-their motive; and I will make that right, and then it is Thy business to make the rest right.\u2019 And so, \u2018great peace have they which love Thy law.\u2019  </p> <p>An obedient life not only delivers us from the distractions of miscellaneous desires, and from the anxiety of unforeseen results, but it contributes to tranquillity in another way. The thing that makes us most uneasy is either sin done or duty neglected. Either of these, however small it may appear, is like a horse-hair upon the sheets of a bed, or a little wrinkle in that on which a man lies, disturbing all his repose. No man is really at rest unless his conscience is clear. \u2018The wicked is like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.\u2019 But if the uttered will of the Lord is our supreme object, then in this direction, too, tranquillity is ours.  </p> <p>IV. Lastly, such a love gives the peace of freedom from temptations. </p> <p>\u2018Nothing shall offend them.\u2019 \u2018There shall be no stumbling-block to them.\u2019 The higher love casts out the lower. It is well, when, by reinforcing conscience by considerations of duty, or even sometimes by the lower thoughts of consequences, a man is able to pass by a temptation which appeals to him, and conquers the inclination to go wrong. But it is far better-and it is possible-to be lifted up into such a region as that the temptation does not appeal to him any more.  </p> <p>To take a very homely illustration, whether is it better for a man to steel himself, and walk past the door of a public-house, though the fumes appeal to his sense, and stir his inclinations; or to go past, and never know any attraction to enter? Which is best, to overcome our temptations, or to live away up in the high regions to which the malaria of the swamps never climbs, and where no disease-germs can ever reach?  </p> <p>That elevation is possible for us, if only we keep in close touch with God, and love the law because our hearts are knit to the Law-giver. \u2018There shall be no occasion of stumbling in him,\u2019 as the Apostle John varies the expression of my text. Within, there will be no traitors to surrender the camp to the enemy without. So Paul in the letter to the Philippians attributes to \u2018the peace of God which passeth understanding\u2019 a military function, and says that it will \u2018garrison the heart and mind,\u2019 and keep them \u2018in Christ Jesus,\u2019 which is but the Christian way of saying, \u2018Great peace have they which love Thy law; and there is no occasion of stumbling in them.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"Topics/law/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"Topics/leadership/","title":"Leadership","text":""},{"location":"Topics/leadership/#spurgeon-on-psalm-7324","title":"Spurgeon on Psalm 73:24","text":"<p>Sermon link Haste too, is the author of a great deal of mischief in human life.

She did not set up to be a heroine, and say, \u201cNow I am a follower of JEHOVAH, I must be doing something extraordinary.\u201d She did not pack up her clothes, and start off to some distant place where she could find more glittering service for JEHOVAH, but she stopped where she was and served God there. She minded her own guests and kept her own house. </p> <p>I believe that home duties are one of the very best forms of the activity of faith, especially in Christian women. Our business is not to do what we fancy but what the Lord appoints for us. Of many a Christian woman it is best to have it said, as of Sarah, when they said, \u201cWhere is Sarah?\u201d and the answer was, \u201cIn her tent.\u201d It is a good thing when a Christian feels he will not choose his work but will take the work God chooses for him\ud83d\udd25, he resolves not to ape somebody else, but to follow the special path which the Lord marks out for him.</p> <p>Now Rahab was not to anticipate Joel, and drive a tent pin through the head of the King of Jericho, nor to be a Deborah and call some Barak to the battle.

May we see in all of you who are Christians the faith which works in its own sphere, may you exhibit the religion of common things. Do not believe in knight-errantry. Do not be spiritual Don Quixotes. God has made you what you are, a mother, or a daughter, a husband, a servant, or a master, serve God as such. There is something for you to do in your position. Extraordinary calls may come, and I pray they may come to some here present, but they are not likely to be given to those who cannot use their present everyday opportunities. We may be called to very special service and have special grace given, but it is best for us till such calls are felt to mind our business in the station of life in which God has placed us. Moses kept sheep till he was bidden to deliver Israel, Gideon was threshing when the angel appeared to him, and the disciples were fishing when Jesus called them. They used diligence in their callings, and then threw their hearts into their higher calling. So Rahab did. The spies came to her, she received them in peace, she hid them, and after she hid them she let them down by a rope from her house on the wall, which perhaps she had done before to very different characters.

We need not be so eager to load ourselves with more. He is the best draftsman, not who draws the largest, but the most perfect circle. If the circle is perfect, nobody finds fault with it because it is not large. Fill your sphere, brother, and be content with it. If God shall move you to another, be glad to be moved. If He moves you to a smaller, be as willing to go to a less prominent place as to one that is more so. Have no will about it. Be a weaned child that has given up fretting, crying, worrying, and leaves its mother to do just what seems good in her sight.

And so it is always. You go down one turning rather than another, and your whole career is coloured thereby. You miss a train, and you escape death. Our lives are like the Cornish rocking stones, pivoted on little points. The most apparently insignificant things have a strange knack of suddenly developing unexpected consequences, and turning out to be, not small things at all, but great and decisive and fruitful.</p> <p>Let us then look with ever fresh wonder on this marvellous contexture of human life, and on Him that moulds it all to His own perfect purposes. Let us bring the highest and largest principles to bear on the smallest events and circumstances, for you can never tell which of these is going to turn out a revolutionary and formative influence in your life. And if the highest Christian principle is not brought to bear upon the trifles, depend upon it, it will never be brought to bear upon the mighty things. The most part of every life is made up of trifles, and unless these are ruled by the highest motives, life, which is divided into grains like the sand, will have gone by, while we are waiting for the great events which we think worthy of being regulated by lofty principles. \u2018Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves.\u2019</p> <p>Let us learn the lesson, too, of quiet confidence in Him in whose hands the whole puzzling, overwhelming mystery lies. If a man once begins to think of how utterly incalculable the consequences of the smallest and most commonplace of his deeds may be, how they may run out into all eternity, and like divergent lines may enclose a space that becomes larger and wider the further they travel; if, I say, a man once begins to indulge in thoughts like these, it is difficult for him to keep himself calm and sane at all, unless he believes in the great loving Providence that lies above all, and shapes the vicissitude and mystery of life. We can leave all in His hands-and if we are wise we shall do so-to whom great and small are terms that have no meaning; and who looks upon men\u2019s lives, not according to the apparent magnitude of the deeds with which they are filled, but simply according to the motive from which, and the purpose towards which, these deeds were done.</p> <p>II. Then, still further, take this other lesson, which lies very plainly here-the blessedness and honour of helping Jesus Christ.</p> <p>And there is yet another way in which this honour of helping the Lord is given to us. As in His weakness He needed some one to aid Him to bear His Cross, so in His glory He needs our help to carry out the purposes for which the Cross was borne. The paradox of a man\u2019s carrying the Cross of Him who carried the world\u2019s burden is repeated in another form. He needs nothing, and yet He needs us. He needs nothing, and yet He needed that ass which was tethered at \u2018the place where two ways met,\u2019 in order to ride into Jerusalem upon it. He does not need man\u2019s help, and yet He does need it, and He asks for it. And though He bore Simon the Cyrenian\u2019s sins \u2018in His own body on the tree,\u2019 He needed Simon the Cyrenian to help Him to bear the tree, and He needs us to help Him to spread throughout the world the blessed consequences of that Cross and bitter Passion. So to us all is granted the honour, and from us all are required the sacrifice and the service, of helping the suffering Saviour.</p> <p>III. Another of the lessons which may very briefly be drawn from this story is that of the perpetual recompense and record of the humblest Christian work.</p> <p>So we may say, it shall be always, \u2018I will never forget any of their works.\u2019 We may not leave our deeds inscribed in any records that men can read. What of that, If they are written in letters of light in the \u2018Lamb\u2019s Book of Life,\u2019 to be read out by Him before His Father and the holy angels, in that last great day? We may not leave any separable traces of our services, any more than the little brook that comes down some gulley on the hillside flows separate from its sisters, with whom it has coalesced, in the bed of the great river, or in the rolling, boundless ocean, What of that so long as the work, in its consequences, shall last? Men that sow some great prairie broadcast cannot go into the harvest-field and say, \u2018I sowed the seed from which that ear came, and you the seed from which this one sprang.\u2019 But the waving abundance belongs to them all, and each may be sure that his work survives and is glorified there,-\u2019that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.\u2019 So a perpetual remembrance is sure for the smallest Christian service.</p> <p>IV. The last lesson that I would draw is, let us learn from this incident the blessed results of contact with the suffering Christ.</p> <p>And it is the only way by which any of us will ever learn the true mystery and miracle of Christ\u2019s great and loving Being and work. I beseech you, take your places there behind Him, near His Cross; gazing upon Him till your hearts melt, and you, too, learn that He is your Lord, and your Saviour, and your God. The Cross of Jesus Christ divides men into classes as the Last Day will. It, too, parts men-\u2019sheep\u2019 to the right hand, \u2018goats\u2019 to the left. If there was a penitent, there was an impenitent thief; if there was a convinced centurion, there were gambling soldiers; if there were hearts touched with compassion, there were mockers who took His very agonies and flung them in His face as a refutation of His claims. On the day when that Cross was reared on Calvary it began to be what it has been ever since, and is at this moment to every soul who hears the Gospel, \u2018a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.\u2019 Contact with the suffering Christ will either bind you to His service, and fill you with His Spirit, or it will harden your hearts, and make you tenfold more selfish-that is to say, \u2018tenfold more a child of hell\u2019-than you were before you saw and heard of that divine meekness of the suffering Christ.\ud83d\udd25 Look to Him, I beseech you, who bears what none can help Him to carry, the burden of the world\u2019s sin. Let Him bear yours, and yield to Him your grateful obedience, and then take up your cross daily, and bear the light burden of self-denying service to Him who has borne the heavy load of sin for you and all mankind.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/meekness%2Cgreatness/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"Topics/meekness%2Cgreatness/#barnes-on-matthew-53","title":"Barnes on Matthew 5:3","text":"<p>To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands; to be willing to be in his hands, and to feel that we deserve no favor from him.

Then we see answered prayer.</p> <p>iv. If something is God\u2019s will, why doesn\u2019t He just do it, apart from our prayers? Why would He wait to accomplish His will until we pray? Because God has appointed us to work with Him as 2 Corinthians 6:1 says: as workers together with Him. God wants us to work with Him, and that means bringing our will and agenda into alignment with His.

If you think that your prayers help in any degree to put away sin, you make an antichrist of your prayers. Christ\u2019s blood and righteousness form the only ground of your acceptance before God.

In our war with our American colonists, before they gained their freedom from this country, a certain Highland regiment was engaged. Every evening one of the men was observed to go away from the camp into an adjacent wood, and it was suspected that he had gone to give information to the enemy. He was, therefore, arrested and brought before the colonel of the regiment, and the other officers said to him, \u201cNow tell us what you have been doing while you have been absent from the camp.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI have been accustomed, whenever I can, to retire for an hour or two of private prayer.\u201d</p> <p>The colonel happened to be a Scotchman and a Presbyterian, so he said to the soldier, \u201cWell, you never had such reason to pray before as you have tonight. If you do go for an hour together to pray, you can pray, so let us hear you now.\u201d The man knelt down and poured out his soul before God, seeking deliverance at the Lord\u2019s hands and resigning his spirit into the keeping of his heavenly Father. And he prayed with such an earnest, simple power that, when he had finished, the colonel said to the other officers, \u201cA man who can come on parade like that, must have been drilled a good many times. I think we may confidently accept what he has said as being true. There is no doubt about his having been alone in prayer to God, now that he can pray like that before us.\u201d</p> <p>Happy is the man whose prayer would bear to be listened to by his fellow-men in such a critical season as that, so that they should be compelled to say of him, \u201cThat man has often prayed before tonight, he has the very brogue of one who communes with heaven.\u201d But he who gives such answers as I have been quoting, would certainly not be able to pray before others as that soldier did.</p> <p>It will never do for any man to hope to be saved by putting prayer into the place of genuine repentance and immediate forsaking of sin.</p> <p>I will tell you my own answer to this question. I cry to God, principally, because I cannot help doing so. I cry to God for the same reason that I eat when I feel hungry and for the same reason that I groan when I am in pain. It is the outward expression of the condition of my inward life. I cannot help praying. I think if anyone were to say to me, \u201cYou must not kneel down to pray,\u201d it would not make any difference to my praying. If I were not allowed to utter a word all day long, that would not affect my praying. If I could not have five minutes that I might spend in prayer by myself, I should pray all the same.

There should be some \"place\" to which we may resort where no ear will hear us but \"His\" ear, and no eye can see us but His eye. Unless there is such a place, secret prayer will not be long or strictly maintained. It is often said that we have no such place, and can secure none. We are away from home; we are traveling; we are among strangers; we are in stages and steamboats, and how can we find such places of retirement? I answer, the desire to pray, and the love of prayer, will create such places in abundance. The Saviour had all the difficulties which we can have, but yet he lived in the practice of secret prayer. To be alone, he rose up \"a great while before day,\" and went into a solitary place and prayed, Mark 1:35. With him a grove, a mountain, a garden, furnished such a place, and, though a traveler, and among strangers, and without a house, he lived in the habit of secret prayer. What excuse can they have for not praying who have a home, and who spend the precious hours of the morning in sleep, and who will practice no self-denial that they may be alone with God? O Christian! thy Saviour would have broken in upon these hours, and would have trod his solitary way to the mountain or the grove that he might pray. He did do it. He did it to pray for thee, too indolent and too unconcerned about thy own salvation and that of the world to practice the least self-denial in order to commune with God! How can religion live thus? How can such a soul be saved?</p> <p>The Saviour does not specify the times when we should pray in secret. He does not say how often it should be done. The reasons may have been:</p> <p>(1) that he designed that his religion should be \"voluntary,\" and there is not a better \"test\" of true piety than a disposition to engage often in secret prayer. He intended to leave it to his people to show attachment to him by coming to God often, and as often as they chose.</p> <p>(2) an attempt to specify the times when this should be done would tend to make religion formal and heartless. Mohammed undertook to regulate this, and the consequence is a cold and formal prostration at the appointed hours of prayer all over the land where his religion has spread.</p> <p>(3) the periods are so numerous, and the seasons for secret prayer vary so much, that it would nor be easy to fix rules when this should be done.</p> <p>Yet without giving rules, where the Saviour has given none, we may suggest the following as times when secret prayer is proper:</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the morning. Nothing can be more appropriate when we have been preserved through the night, and when we are about to enter upon the duties and dangers of another day, than to render to our great Preserver thanks, and to commit ourselves to His fatherly care.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the evening. When the day has closed, what would be more natural than to offer thanksgiving for the mercies of the day, and to implore forgiveness for what we have said or done amiss? And when about to lie down again to sleep, not knowing but it may be our last sleep and that we may awake in eternity, what more proper than to commend ourselves to the care of Him \"who never slumbers nor sleeps?\"</p> </li> <li> <p>We should pray in times of embarrassment and perplexity. Such times occur in every man's life, and it is then a privilege and a duty to go to God and seek his direction. In the most difficult and embarrassed time of the American Revolution, Washington was seen to retire to a grove in the vicinity of the camp at Valley Forge. Curiosity led a man to observe him, and the father of his country was seen on his knees supplicating the God of hosts in prayer. Who can tell how much the liberty of this nation is owing to the answer to the secret prayer of Washington?</p> </li> <li> <p>We should pray when we are beset with strong temptations. So the Saviour prayed in the garden of Gethsemane (compare Hebrews 5:7-8), and so we should pray when we are tempted.</p> </li> <li> <p>We should pray when the Spirit prompts us to pray; when we feel lust like praying; when nothing can satisfy the soul but prayer. Such times occur in the life of every Christian, (and they are \"spring-times\" of piety - favorable gales to waft us on to heaven. Prayer to the Christian, at such times, is just as congenial as conversation with a friend when the bosom is filled with love; as the society of father, mother, sister, child is, when the heart glows with attachment; as the strains of sweet music are to the ear best attuned to the love of harmony; as the most exquisite poetry is to the heart enamored with the muses; and as the most delicious banquet is to the hungry.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Prayer, then, is the element of being - the breath the vital air; and, then, the Christian must and should pray. He is the most eminent Christian who is most favored with such strong emotions urging him to prayer. The heart is then full; the soul is tender; the sun of glory shines with unusual splendor; no cloud intervenes; the Christian rises above the world, and pants for glory. then we may go to be alone with God. We may enter the closet, and breathe forth our warm desires into his ever-open ear, and He who sees in secret will reward us openly.</p> <p>In secret - Who is unseen.</p> <p>Who seeth in secret - Who sees what the human eye cannot see; who sees the real designs and desires of the heart.

We must ourselves feel the weight of that burden of the Lord which we proclaim to others, or we shall not be ministers of the apostolic sort, but rather shall be descendants of the hypocritical Pharisees who bound heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, upon other men\u2019s shoulders, but were not willing to touch them with so much as one of their fingers. The apostle Paul could with peculiar propriety, call the Gospel his own. On the road to Damascus he had singularly experienced its mighty power. And afterwards, in trials oft, in difficulties many, in experiences varied, in temptations furious, he had made each truth of Scripture his own by having tasted its sweetness, handled its strength, proved its comfort, and tried its power. Do not think of preaching, young man, until you have truth written on your very soul. As well think of steering the Great Eastern across the ocean without knowing the first principles of navigation. As well think of setting up as an ambassador without your country\u2019s sanction, as to dare to intrude yourself into the Christian ministry unless the Gospel is first your own. No amount of training at Oxford, or Cambridge, or anywhere else, no extent of classical or mathematical teaching can ever make you a minister of Jesus Christ, if you lack the first necessary, namely, a personal interest in salvation by Jesus Christ. What! Will you profess to be a physician, while the leprosy is on your own brow? Will you attempt to stand between the living and the dead when you are yourself devoid of spiritual life? The priests of old were touched with the blood upon their thumb, the toe, and the ear, to show that they were consecrated everywhere. And none among us must dare to exercise any office for God among His people till first of all we know the cleansing, quickening, refining, sanctifying power of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. It must be our Gospel before we may so much as think of aspiring to the high and holy office of the Gospel ministry. But this alone is not sufficient. The Christian minister, if he would imitate Paul, must be very careful of his manner of life among the people. He must be able to say without blushing, \u201cYou know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.\u201d Unselfishness must be our prominent attribute, all must be done for our people\u2019s sake. And then, we must in our lives show the truthfulness of our unselfish professions.

Then the rich harvest will wave before him. Then he will thrust in his sickle and reap. Then he will gather the golden grain, and the wain will groan under the burden, and the sheaves will be carried forth with songs of joy. He will be abundantly rewarded for all his toil; he will see the fruit of his labors; he will be filled with joy. The design of this illustration was, undoubtedly, to cheer the hearts of the exiles in their long and dangerous journey to their native land; it has, however, a wider and more universal application, as being suited to encourage all in their endeavors to secure their own salvation, and to do good in the world - for the effort is often attended with sacrifice, toil, and tears. The joy of heaven will be more than a compensation for all this. The following remarks by Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book, vol. i., pp. 118, 119) will furnish an illustration of the meaning of this passage: \"I never saw people sowing in tears exactly, but have often known them to do it in fear and distress sufficient to draw them from any eye. In seasons of great scarcity, the poor peasants part in sorrow with every measure of precious seed cast into the ground. It is like taking bread out of the mouths of their children; and in such times many bitter tears are actually shed over it. The distress is frequently so great that government is obliged to furnish seed, or none would be sown. Ibrahim Pasha did this more than once within my remembrance, copying the example, perhaps, of his great predecessor in Egypt when the seven years' famine was ended. The thoughts of this psalm may likewise have been suggested by the extreme danger which frequently attends the farmer in his plowing and sowing.</p> <p>The calamity which fell upon the farmers of Job when the oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword Job 1:14-15, is often repeated in our day. To understand this, you must remember what I just told you about the situation of the arable lands in the open country; and here again we meet that verbal accuracy: the sower goes forth - that is, from the village. The people of Ibel and Khiem, in Merj \u201bAiyun, for example, have their best grain-growing fields down in the \u201bArd Huleh, six or eight miles from their homes, and just that much nearer the lawless border of the desert. When the country is disturbed, or the government weak, they cannot sow these lands except at the risk of their lives. Indeed, they always go forth in large companies, and completely armed, ready to drop the plow and seize the musket at a moment's warning; and yet, with all this care, many sad and fatal calamities overtake the people who must thus sow in tears.</p> <p>And still another origin may be found for the thoughts of the psalm in the extreme difficulty of the work itself in many places. The soil is rocky, impracticable, overgrown with sharp thorns; and it costs much painful toil to break up and gather out the rocks, cut and burn the briers, and to subdue the stubborn soil, especially with their feeble oxen and insignificant plows. Join all these together, and the sentiment is very forcibly brought out, that he who labors hard, in cold and in rain, in fear and danger, in poverty and in want, casting his precious seed in the ground, will surely come again, at harvest-time, with rejoicing, and bearing his sheaves with him.\"</p>"},{"location":"Topics/suffering/#barnes","title":"barnes","text":""},{"location":"Topics/suffering/#spurgeon-on-hebrews-218","title":"Spurgeon on Hebrews 2:18","text":"<p>Sermon He could not yield to temptation, but He did suffer from it.

There He showed His grief when He sweat as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.

The passage is found in Deuteronomy 8:3. In that place the discourse is respecting manna. Moses says that the Lord humbled the people, and fed them with manna, an unusual kind of food, that they might learn that man did not live by bread only, but that there were other things to support life, and that everything which God had commanded was proper for this. The term \"word,\" used in this place, means very often, in Hebrew, thing, and clearly in this place has that meaning. Neither Moses nor our Saviour had any reference to spiritual food, or to the doctrines necessary to support the faith of believers; but they simply meant that God could support life by other things than bread; that man was to live, not by that only, but by every other thing which proceeded out of his mouth; that is, which he chose to command people to eat. The substance of his answer, then, is: \"It is not so imperiously necessary that I should have bread as to make a miracle proper to procure it. Life depends on the will of God. He can support it in other ways as well as by bread. He has created other things to be eaten, and man may live by everything that his Maker has commanded.\" And from this temptation we may learn:</p> <ol> <li> <p>That Satan often takes advantage of our circumstances and wants to tempt us. The poor, the hungry, and the naked he often tempts to repine and complain, and to be dishonest in order to supply their necessities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Satan's temptations are often the strongest immediately after we have been remarkably favored. Jesus had just been called the Son of God, and Satan took this opportunity to try him. He often attempts to fill us with pride and vain self-conceit when we have been favored with any peace of mind, or any new view of God, and endeavors to urge us to do something which may bring us low and lead us to sin.</p> </li> <li> <p>His temptations are plausible. They often seem to be only urging us to do what is good and proper. They seem even to urge us to promote the glory of God, and to honor him. We are not to think, therefore, that because a thing may seem to be good in itself, that therefore it is to be done. Some of the most powerful temptations of Satan occur when he seems to be urging us to do what shall be for the glory of God.</p> </li> <li> <p>We are to meet the temptations of Satan, as the Saviour did, with the plain and positive declarations of Scripture. We are to inquire whether the thing is commanded, and whether, therefore, it is right to do it, and not trust to our own feelings, or even our wishes, in the matter.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Topics/temptation/#barnes","title":"barnes","text":""},{"location":"Topics/temptation/#spurgeon-on-hebrews-218","title":"Spurgeon on Hebrews 2:18","text":"<p>Sermon First, that temptation to sin is no sin.

You may be horribly tempted, and yet no blame whatever may attach to you, for it is no fault of yours that you are tempted. You need not repent of that which has no sin in it. If you yield to the temptation, therein is sin, but the mere fact that you are tempted, however horrible the temptation, is no sin of yours.</p> <p>And in the next place, temptation does not show any displeasure on God\u2019s part. He permitted His Only-begotten Son to be tempted; He was always the Son of His love, and yet He was tried. \u201cThis is My beloved Son,\u201d said He at His baptism, and yet the next hour that Son was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. It does not even show displeasure on God\u2019s part that He permits you to be tempted; on the contrary, it may be consistent with the clearest manifestations of divine favor.</p> <p>And again, temptation really implies no doubt of your being a son of God, for the Son of God was tempted, even the unquestioned Son of the Highest.

It did not in your Lord\u2019s case lead up to sin. The Lord Jesus was as innocent in temptation and after temptation as before it, and so may we be through His grace. It is written by the beloved John concerning the man that is born of God that \u201cHe keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, do not make it any cause of complaint that you are tempted. If your Lord was tempted, shall the disciple be above his Master, or the servant above his Lord? If the Perfect One must endure temptation; why not you?

They of old overcame through the blood of the Lamb, and you shall do the like.

Paul was not ashamed to labor with \"his own hands\" Acts 20:35; and no man is dishonored by labor. God made man for toil Genesis 2:15; and employment is essential to the happiness of the race. No man, who is \"able\" to support himself, has a \"right\" to depend on others; see the notes on Romans 12:11.  </p> <p>That he may have to give to him that needeth - Margin, \"distribute.\" Not merely that may have the means of support, but that he may have it in his power to aid others. The reason and propriety of this is obvious. The human race is one great brotherhood. A considerable part \"cannot\" labor to support themselves. They are too old, or too young; or they are crippled, or feeble, or laid on beds of sickness. If others do not divide with them the avails of their labors, they will perish. We are required to laboar in order that we may have the privilege of contributing to their comfort. Learn from this verse:  </p> <ol> <li>That every Christian should have some calling, business, or profession, by which he may support himself. The Saviour was carpenter; Paul a tentmaker; and no man is disgraced by being able to build a house or to construct a tent.  </li> <li>Christianity promotes industry. It is rare that an idle man becomes a Christian; but if he does, religion makes him industrious just in proportion as it has influence over his mind. To talk of a \"lazy Christian,\" is about the same as to talk of burning water or freezing fire.  </li> <li>Christians should have some useful and honest employment. They should work \"that which is good.\" They should not pursue an employment which will necessarily injure others. No man has a right to place a nuisance under the window of his neighbor; nor has he any \"more\" right to pursue an employment that shall lead his neighbor into sin or ruin him. An honest employment benefits everybody . A good farmer is a benefit to his neighborhood and country; and a good shoemaker, blacksmith, weaver, cabinetmaker, watchmaker, machinist, is a blessing to the community. He injures no one; he benefits all. How is it with the distiller, and the vender of alcoholic drinks? He benefits no one; he injures every body. Every quart of intoxicating drink that is taken from his house does evil somewhere - evil, and only evil, and that continually. No one is made better, or richer; no one is made more moral or industrious; no one is helped on the way to heaven by it. Thousands are helped on the way to hell by it, who are already in the path; and thousands are \"induced\" to walk in the way to death who, but for that distillery, store, or tavern, might have walked in the way to heaven. Is this then \"working that which is good?\" Would Paul have done it? Would Jesus do it? Strange, that by a professing Christian it was ever done! See a striking instance of the way in which the Ephesian Christians acted when they were first converted, in the Acts of the Apostles, Acts 19:19; compare notes on that place.  </li> <li> <p>the main business of a Christian is not to \"make money,\" and to become rich. It is that he may have the means of benefiting others. Beyond what he needs for himself, his poor, and sick, and aged, and afflicted brother and friend has a claim on his earnings - and they should be liberally bestowed.  </p> </li> <li> <p>we should labor in \"order\" that we may have the means of doing good to others. It should be just as much a matter of plan and purpose to do this, as it is to labor in order to buy a coat, or to build a house, or to live comfortably, or to have the means of a decent burial. Yet how few are those who have any such end in view, or who pursue their daily toil definitely, \"that they may have something to give away!\" The world will be soon converted when all Christians make that the purpose of life; see the notes on Romans 12:11.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Topics/wealth%2Cwork/#barnes","title":"barnes","text":""},{"location":"Topics/wealth%2Cwork/#enduringword-on-1-timothy-618","title":"EnduringWord on 1 Timothy 6:18","text":"<p>Many think the main reason for giving unto the Lord is because the church needs money.

Mere early rising, without his blessing, would not secure what they hoped to accomplish, for everything is still in the hand of God. Health, strength, clearness of mind, and success, are all under his control; and though early rising may tend to produce all these - as it does in fact - yet still people are not the less dependent on God for success.</p> <p>To sit up late - That you may labor or study. As in the former case the psalmist does not express any opinion about the propriety or impropriety of early rising, so it is in respect to this. He merely says that if it is done, this, of itself, will not accomplish the object; people are still dependent on God for success though they do it. As a matter of fact, however, sitting up late has less tendency to promote success in life than early rising; but in either ease there is the same dependence on God.</p> <p>To eat the bread of sorrows - Bread of care, anxiety, or trouble; that is, bread earned or procured by the severity of toil. There may be an allusion here to the original sentence pronounced on man, Genesis3#v.17. The meaning is, that it is in vain that you labor hard, that you exhaust your strength, in order to get bread to eat, unless God shall bless you. After all your toil the result is with him.</p> <p>For so he giveth his beloved sleep - The word \"for\" is not in the original, The sentence is very obscure in the connection in which it stands. The Septuagint and Latin Vulgate render it, \"Ye who eat the bread of care - rise when you have rested - when he hath given his beloved sleep.\" Some have supposed it to mean that God gives his people rest without toil, or that, while others labor, his \"beloved\" - his friends - sleep; but this interpretation is not necessarily demanded by the Hebrew, and is inconsistent with the general doctrine of the Bible. Others have supposed the idea to be, that God gives his beloved rest after labor; but though this is true, it is not true of them especially or exclusively. Some suppose, with as little probability, that the meaning is, that what others hope (but hope in vain) to get by labor, the Lord bestows upon his people in sleep, they know not how.</p> <p>The meaning evidently is, that God bestows \"sleep\" upon his people in some sense in which it is not bestowed on others, or that there is, in regard to their case, something in which they differ from those who are so anxious and troubled - who rise so early for the sake of gain - who toil so late - who eat the bread of care. The idea seems to be that there would be calmness, repose, freedom from anxiety or solicitude. God makes the mind of his people - his beloved - calm and tranquil, while the world around is filled with anxiety and restlessness - busy, bustling, worried. As a consequence of this calmness of mind, and of their confidence in him, they enjoy undisturbed repose at night. They are not kept wakeful and anxious about their worldly affairs as other men are, for they leave all with God, and thus he \"giveth his beloved sleep.\" The particle \"so\" - \u05db\u05df ke\u0302n - or \"thus,\" I apprehend, refers to the general sense of what had been said, rather than to what immediately precedes it; to the fact that all success depends on God Psalm 127:1, and that it is always by his interposition, and not as the result of human skill, toil, or fatigue, that people find calmness, success, repose.

All \u2018Western Christendom,\u2019 as it is called, is to-day commemorating the Pentecostal gift. My text speaks about that power that \u2018worketh in us mightily.\u2019 True, the Apostle is speaking in reference to the fiery energy and persistent toil which characterised him in proclaiming Christ, that he might present men perfect before Him. But the same energy which he expended on his apostolic office he expended on his individual personality. And he would not have discharged the one unless he had first laboured on the other.</p> <p>Some people like to \u2018labour\u2019 so as never to turn a hair, or bring a sweat-drop on to their foreheads. That is not Christian Endeavour. Work that does not \u2018take it out of you\u2019 is not worth doing. The other word \u2018striving\u2019 brings up the picture of the arena with the combatants\u2019 strain of muscle, their set teeth, their quick, short breathing, their deadly struggle. That is Paul\u2019s notion of Endeavour. Now \u2018Endeavour,\u2019 like a great many other words, has a baser and a nobler side to it. Some people, when they say, \u2018I will endeavour,\u2019 mean that they are going to try in a half-hearted way, with no prospect of succeeding. That is not Christian Endeavour. The meaning of the word\u2014for the expression in my text might just as well be rendered \u2018endeavouring\u2019 as \u2018striving\u2019--is that of a buoyant confident effort of all the concentrated powers, with the certainty of success. That is the endeavour that we have to cultivate as Christian men. And there is only one field of human effort in which that absolute confidence that it shall not be in vain is anything but presumptuous arrogance; namely, in the effort after making ourselves what God means us to be, what Jesus Christ longs for us to be, what the Spirit of God is given to us in order that we should be. \u2018We shall not fail,\u2019 ought to be the word of every man and woman when they set themselves to the great task of working out, in their own characters and personalities, the Divine intention which is made a Divine possibility by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the gift of the Divine Spirit.</p> <p>Ah! what a contrast there is between the languid way in which Christian men pursue what the Bible designates their \u2018calling\u2019 and that in which men with far paltrier aims pursue theirs! And what a still sadder contrast there is between the way in which we Christians go about our daily business, and the way in which we go about our Christian life! Why, a man will take more pains to learn some ornamental art, or some game, than he will ever take to make himself a better Christian. The one is work. What is the other? To a very large extent dawdling and make-believe.</p> <p>Work at your religion. That is the great lesson of my text. Endeavour with confidence of success. The Book of Proverbs says: \u2018He that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster,\u2019 and that is true. A man that does \u2018the work of the Lord negligently\u2019 is scarcely to be credited with doing it at all. Dear friends, young or old, if you name the name of Christ, be in earnest, and make earnest work of your Christian character.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfafThere are many ways in which we may state the goal of the Christian life, but let us put it now into the all-comprehensive form of likeness to Jesus Christ, by entire conformity to His Example and full interpretation of His life.</p> <p>There is no other system of thought that paints man as he is, so darkly; there is none that paints man as he is meant to be, in such radiant colours. The blacks upon the palette of Christianity are blacker, and the whites are whiter, and the golden is more radiant, than any other painter has ever mixed.</p> <p>If we are not making ourselves more like Jesus Christ by the way in which we handle our books, or our pen, or our loom, or our scalpel, or our kitchen utensils, then there is little chance of our ever making ourselves like Jesus Christ. For it is these trifles that make life, and to concentrate ourselves on the pursuit of the Christian aim is, in other words, to carry that Christian aim into every triviality of our daily lives.</p> <p>There are three Scripture passages which set forth various aspects of the aim that we have before us, and from each of these aspects deduce the one same lesson. The Apostle says \u2018giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue,\u2019 etc., \u2018for if ye do these things ye shall never fail.\u2019 He also exhorts: \u2018Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.\u2019 And finally he says: \u2018Be diligent, that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot, blameless.\u2019 There are three aspects of the Christian course, and the Christian aim, the addition to our faith of all the clustering graces and virtues and powers that can be hung upon it, like jewels on the neck of a queen; the making our calling and election sure, and the being found at last tranquil, spotless, stainless, and being found so by Him. These great aims are incumbent on all Christians, they require diligence, and ennoble the diligence which they require.</p> <p>For our path is the only path on which men tread that has for its goal an object so far off that it never can be attained, so near that it can ever be approached. This infinite goal of the Christian Endeavour means inspiration for youth, and freshness for old age, and that man is happy who can say: \u2018Not as though I had already attained\u2019 at the end of a long life, and can say it, not because he has failed, but because in a measure he has succeeded.</p> <p>So, dear brethren, the first direct aim of all our endeavour ought to be to receive and to keep and to increase our gift of that Divine Spirit.

He gives first, and then says to you, \u2018Now go to work, and keep that good thing which is committed unto thee.\u2019</p> <p>There is but one thought more in this last part of my text, which I must not leave untouched, and that is that this sufficient and universal gift is not only the means by which the great universal duty can be discharged, but it ought to be the measure in which it is discharged. \u2018I work according to the working in me.\u2019 That is, all the force that came into Paul by that Divine Spirit, came out of Paul in his Christian conduct, and the gift was not only the source, but also the measure, of this man\u2019s Christian Endeavour. Is that true about us? They say that the steam-engine is a most wasteful application of power, that a great deal of the energy which is generated goes without ever doing any work. They tell us that one of the great difficulties in the way of economic application of electricity is the loss which comes through using accumulators. Is not that like a great many of us? So much power poured into us; so little coming out from us and translated into actual work! Such a \u2018rushing mighty wind,\u2019 and the air about us so heavy and stagnant and corrupt! Such a blaze of fire, and we so cold! Such a cataract of the river of the water of life, and our lips parched and our crops seared and worthless! Ah, brethren! when we look at ourselves, and when we think of the condition of so many of the churches to which we belong, the old rebuke of the prophet comes back to us in this generation, \u2018Thou that art named the House of Israel, is the Spirit of the Lord straitened? Are these His doings?\u2019 We have an all-sufficient power. May our working and striving be according to it, and may we work mightily, being \u2018strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might!\u2019</p>"},{"location":"Topics/wealth%2Cwork/#maclaren","title":"maclaren","text":""},{"location":"Topics/wealth%2Cwork/#barnes-on-1-thessalonians-411","title":"Barnes on  1 Thessalonians 4:11","text":"<p>No Christian should be engaged in a mob; none should be identified with the popular excitements which lead to disorder and to the disregard of the laws.</p> <p>Religion teaches no man to neglect his business. It requires no one to give up an honest calling and to be idle. It asks no one to forsake a useful occupation; unless he can exchange it for one more useful. It demands, indeed, that we shall be willing so far to suspend our ordinary labors as to observe the Sabbath; to maintain habits of devotion; to improve our minds and hearts by the study of truth, to cultivate the social affections, and to do good to others as we have an opportunity; but it makes no one idle, and it countenances idleness in no one. A man who is habitually idle can have very slender pretensions to piety. There is enough in this world for every one to do, and the Saviour set such an example of untiring industry in his vocation as to give each one occasion to doubt whether he is his true follower if he is not disposed to be employed.</p> <p>Idleness is one of the great evils of the pagan world in almost every country, and the parent of no small part of their vices. The effect of religion everywhere is to make people industrious; and every man, who is able, should feel himself under sacred obligation to be employed.

No one who has already enough for himself and family, but who can make money to do good to others, has a right to retire from business and to live in idleness (compare Acts 20:34; Ephesians 4:27); no one has a right to live in such a relation as to be wholly dependent on others, if he can support himself; and no one has a right to compel others to labor for him, and to exact their unrequited toil, in order that he may be supported in indolence and ease.</p> <p>No man understands fully the blessings which God has bestowed on him, if he has hands to work and will not work.</p>"},{"location":"Topics/wealth%2Cwork/#barnes_3","title":"barnes","text":""},{"location":"Topics/wealth%2Cwork/#maclaren-on-1-timothy-619","title":"Maclaren on 1 Timothy 6:19","text":"<p>It is very remarkable, especially as coming from Paul. \u2018Lay up a good foundation\u2019--has he not said, \u2018Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ\u2019? \u2018That they may lay hold on eternal life\u2019--has he not said, \u2018The gift of God is eternal life\u2019? Is he not going dead in the teeth of his own teaching, \u2018Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but by His mercy He saved us\u2019?</p> <p>I. First, then, he says that the real life is the future life.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25The complete idea is that the life of the Christian soul here and yonder, away out into the furthest extremities of eternity, and up to the loftiest climax of perfectness, is in essence one, whilst yet the differences between the degree in which its germinal possession here and its full-fruited enjoyment hereafter differ is so great as that, in comparison with the completion that is waiting the Christian soul beyond the grave, all of the same life that is here enjoyed dwindles into nothingness.</p> <p>II. Secondly, notice that conduct here determines the possession of the true life. \u2018Laying up in store for themselves\u2019 is one word in the original, and it contains even more than is expressed in our paraphrase, for it is really \u2018treasuring off.\u2019 And the idea is that the rich man is bade to take a portion of his worldly goods, and, by using these for beneficent purposes, out of them to store a treasure beyond the grave. What is employed thus, and from the right motives and in the right way, is not squandered, but laid up in store. You remember the old epitaph,  </p> <p>\u2018What I spent I lost; What I gave I have.\u2019 </p> <p>Now that is Christ\u2019s teaching, for did He not say: \u2018Sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven\u2019? Did He not say: \u2018Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, . . . but lay up treasures in heaven\u2019?</p> <p>I cannot help reminding you, dear friends, that for a very large number of us, almost the most important influence shaping our characters is the attitude that we take in regard to these things--the getting and the distribution of worldly wealth.\ud83d\udcb0</p> <p>What you are doing here is piling up for you, on the other side of the wall, what you will have to live with, and either get good or evil out of, through all eternity.</p> <p>Now I take it that that does not mean a basis for hope, or anything of that sort, but that it conveys this thought, that our actions here are putting in the foundations on which the eternal building of our future life shall be reared.</p> <p>And so, dear friends, let us remember that this is the reason why our smallest acts are so tremendous that by our actions we are making character, and that character is destiny, here and hereafter. You are putting in the foundations of the building that you have to live in; see that they are of such a sort as will support a house eternal in the heavens.</p> <p>This is the underlying thought, that according to a Christian man\u2019s acts here is his capacity of receiving the real life yonder.  </p> <p>That is not given arbitrarily. Each man gets as much of it when he goes home as he can hold. The tiniest vessel is filled, the largest vessel is filled. But the little vessel may, and will, grow bigger if that which is deposited in it be rightly employed. Let us lay this to heart, that Christian men dare not treat it as a matter of indifference whether to the full they live lives consistent with their profession, and do the will of their Master or no. It is not all the same, and it will not be all the same yonder, whether we have adorned the teaching, or whether our lives have habitually and criminally fallen beneath the level of our professions. Brethren, we are too apt to forget that there is such a thing as being \u2018saved, yet so as by fire\u2019; and that there is such a thing as \u2018having an entrance ministered abundantly into the Kingdom.\u2019 Be you sure of this, that if the hands of your spirits are ever to be capable of grasping the prize, it must be as the result of conduct here on earth, which has been treasuring up treasures yonder, and laying a foundation on which the incorruptible house may solidly rest.</p> <p>III. And now the last word that I have to say is that these principles are perfectly compatible with the great truth of salvation by faith. </p> <p>For observe to whom the text is spoken. It is to men who have professed to be believers, and it is on the ground of their faith that these rich men in Timothy\u2019s churches are exhorted to this conduct. There is no incompatibility between the doctrine that eternal life is the gift of God, and the placing of those who have received that gift under a strict law of recompense.  </p> <p>That is the teaching of the whole New Testament. It was to Christian men that it was said: \u2018Be not deceived; God is not mocked, whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.\u2019 It is the teaching of Jesus Christ Himself.</p> <p>But there is a dreadful danger that we, with our partial vision, shall see one side of the truth so clearly that we do not see the other; and so you get two antagonistic schools of Christian teaching who have torn the one word into halves. One of them says, \u2018Man is saved by faith only,\u2019 and forgets \u2018faith without works is dead\u2019; and the other says, \u2018Do your duty, and never mind about your belief,\u2019 and forgets that the belief--the trust--is the only sure foundation on which conduct can be based, and the only source from which it is certain to flow.</p> <p>Now, if I should not be misunderstood by that same narrow and contracted vision of which I have been speaking, I would venture to say that salvation by faith alone may be so held as to be a very dangerous doctrine, and that there is a very real sense in which a man is saved by works. And if you do not like that, go home and read the Epistle of James, and see what you make of his teaching: \u2018Ye see, brethren, how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.\u2019 \u2018Faith wrought with his works, and by his works was his faith made perfect.\u2019</p> <p>Remember that it is for you, resting on Christ, to treasure up eternal life; for you to build on that sure foundation gold and silver and precious stones which may stand the fire; for you, by faithful continuance in well-doing, to lay hold of that for which you have been laid hold of by Jesus Christ.
